For example, people sometimes complain that they have been thinking so much that their head hurts. Another phrase is that a person might proclaim that their brain is on fire, meaning that they are straining their thinking capacity to its limit. There is mental exhaustion, mental exertion, and mental overloading. Sometimes we go out of our way to avoid having to put effort into thinking. You might opt to forego trying to solve a knotty problem or perhaps lean into someone else and ask them what their thoughts are.

Whether you’re an outdoor enthusiast, wildlife observer, security professional, or just someone fascinated by the nocturnal world, the Seemor goggles are designed to elevate your experiences to the next level. These aren’t just any night vision goggles; they incorporate cutting-edge AI-ISP technology and a high-performing CMOS sensor to deliver full-color vision even in ultra-low light conditions. Imagine stepping into the night and seeing everything in vivid, lifelike color instead of the usual green or black-and-white images. The AKASO Seemor promises to bring the night to life, making it an essential tool for anyone eager to explore, observe, and capture the beauty that unfolds after dusk. Designer: AKASO Click Here to Buy Now: $239.99 $289.99 ($50 off). Hurry, deal ends in 48-hours!  At the heart of Seemor is the groundbreaking AI-ISP technology, a synergy of AI algorithms and Image Signal Processing (ISP) that effortlessly simulates and restores colors based on the current lighting conditions. With an exceptional color reproduction rate of up to 99%, it’s almost as if you’re looking at the world during the day. In addition, the larger 1/1.79-inch CMOS sensor captures more light, providing bright and clear full-color images even in low-light conditions. No more green-tinted or black-and-white views—experience the full spectrum of colors, even under the faintest ambient light, and witness nature’s true beauty after dark. AKASO Seemor stands out by seamlessly integrating AI-ISP technology with CMOS, resulting in an exceptional color reproduction rate of up to 99% even in challenging ultra-low-light environments, surpassing other night vision products. AKASO Seemor stands out by seamlessly integrating AI-ISP technology with CMOS, resulting in an exceptional color reproduction rate of up to 99% even in challenging ultra-low-light environments, surpassing other night vision products. That said, you also have full control over how you want to see the world at night. Versatility is key, and Seemor delivers two observation modes, AI full-color and a seven-level infrared (IR) black-and-white, allowing you to adapt to different lighting conditions with a manual switch. This flexibility means that no matter where you are or what you’re doing, Seemor provides the perfect view. With AI Full Color, you get to see the beauty of the night as if it were daytime, while IR mode enhances your ability to see even when there is no ambient light.  Night vision cameras often carry the stereotype of producing grainy, low-res images, but the AKASO Seemor will blow your mind with its 4K video and 4MP photo capabilities. Thanks to its large CMOS sensor, the night vision goggles ensure that every detail is sharp and vibrant. These high-definition captures ensure that every moment from your nocturnal adventures is preserved with exceptional clarity and vividness.  You can instantly watch these moments on the built-in 3-inch screen, making it feel like you’re right there up close, while 2.4G Wi-Fi connectivity lets you monitor using your phone and instantly share your nighttime shots with ease. This feature is a real game-changer when you’re out camping—check out what’s happening both inside and outside your tent without stepping into the cold night.   Worried about battery life cutting short your expeditions? Seemor’s got you covered with two replaceable 3250mAh batteries, each lasting up to 4 hours. With a total of 8 hours, you can explore all night long without a hitch. Plus, it comes with an accessory package to make your adventures smoother and more enjoyable. Whether you’re on a nighttime hike or a late-night wildlife observation, Seemor’s long-lasting battery life ensures you’re never left in the dark.

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Google is rolling out iOS support for its Gmail Q&A feature, which gives users a Gemini-powered AI assistant to help manage their inbox. The Gemini side panel for Gmail was introduced to web and Android devices earlier this year and can potentially provide an easier way to locate specific information that’s buried within emails and Google Drive. Users can ask the Gmail chatbot questions about the contents of their inbox or connected Google Drive, such as finding lost contact information or company data. The Gmail Q&A feature can summarize emails around a particular topic, surface unread messages or emails from a specific sender, and answer general questions from Google search directly within the inbox.

And as the coach of her daughter’s high school volleyball team in Caledonia, Michigan, Brown’s attention was constantly split between watching the games and tallying each player’s statistics by hand. But this year, her daughter’s traveling club team purchased an artificial intelligence service called Balltime for all players aged 12 to 18. A single phone or tablet placed behind the court’s endline records a game and uploads it to the company’s platform, which uses body and object recognition algorithms to track each player so that their every ball contact and movement on the court can be cataloged and datafied. By the time a player has gotten home from a game and showered, the service can prepare personalized stat reports and social media-ready highlight packages. It also gives coaches a bevy of data that was previously only available to professional and elite college volleyball programs. Balltime automatically measures how high in the air players make contact with the ball, their kill and error percentages, ball trajectories, serve speeds, and which rotations of players score the most. It’s part of a growing sports technology industry selling computer vision algorithms, wearable biometric sensors, and predictive analytics services to youth clubs and high school athletics departments, opening up a new world of video and data analysis that—for better or worse—is changing the way young athletes and their families experience sports. Without needing to spend hours cutting together videos themselves, teams can gather comprehensive video evidence to show, rather than tell, young players what they did right and wrong. And coaches and college recruiters say platforms like Balltime and Darkhorse AI, which provides a similar player-tracking service for soccer, are allowing them to make more data-driven decisions about rosters and playing time. “It has helped me already this season with some of the difficult conversations I’ve had to have with players and parents,” Brown said. “[I can tell them] it’s not because I don’t like your kid, this is a computer system and software system that are rating these things based on these parameters.” As valuable as they can be to help players learn and improve, some coaches worry the data and highlight packages produced by AI analytics services also supercharge unhealthy competition among young athletes vying for attention from recruiters and on social media. “There’s this mad rush right now to use these tools to self promote and there’s this pit of loneliness that can happen when you don’t get that attention,” said Ben Bahr, a former college coach and data analyst who now works as director of coaching for Adrenaline Volleyball in Iowa, which uses Balltime. “With the rise of AI and sharing of data, the thing that’s come out of this the most is that it’s become much easier to compare yourself with what someone else is doing.”  The push for advanced data analytics is part of the growing monetization of children’s sports. A report frequently cited by sports technology investors estimates that the youth sports market had a global value of $37.5 billion in 2022 that will grow to $69.4 billion by 2030, rivaling some of the world’s most popular professional leagues. Private equity firms have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to buy youth sports complexes and teenagers are now competing not just for spots on college rosters but also for life-changing money from name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, thanks to a 2021 Supreme Court case that opened the door to private sponsorships for college athletes. “There is definitely a downward move toward more professionalized youth sports,” Dan Banon, Balltime’s CEO, told Gizmodo. He and chief technology officer Tom Raz began building the platform with adults in mind but soon realized the biggest potential for growth was in traveling club teams and high schools. Over the past year, he said, the company has seen more signups from junior varsity teams and even middle school programs. Their data shows that some players spend seven hours a month reviewing footage on Balltime. At $25 per month for a player, Balltime’s recruiting package isn’t for everyone. But with the average household spending $883 a year on a single child’s primary sport, according to a parent survey from the Aspen Institute’s Project Play, the additional cost is also well within many families’ sports budgets. Responding to pressure from families who want their children to have every advantage, some elite clubs are looking for even more ways to combine, collect, and analyze player data. Mustang Soccer League, based in Danville, California is in the process of building out a data analytics department and some players can expect to spend an additional $250 a year on technology subscriptions, said Fred Wilson, the club’s executive director. Mustang recently introduced Darkhorse AI for its 12 to 18-year-old teams and is beginning to discuss high-level analytics with players as young as 10. Like Balltime, Darkhorse uses object recognition algorithms to track players during games, automatically cataloging various stats and curating highlight reels. Some Mustang teams also link that information with biometric data like heart rate and running speed captured by Beyond Pulse wearable sensors. “I don’t know how much learning we’re going to do with 10-year-olds, but I’m trying to instill a habit so that when they’re 14 or 15 they’re paying attention to these things … make it just second nature for players to understand,” Wilson said. The club boasts several former players who are now professionals and dozens more at top college programs. “This whole AI piece takes us to that next level to be able to do that,” Wilson said. “I take 200 calls a year [from sports technology vendors] to find the gem.” Most of them are “out trying to make a quick buck,” he added, but some are offering real value. Karin Pfeiffer, director of the Institute for the Study of Youth Sports at Michigan State University, said that even at the college level, where wearable biometric sensors and data analytics have been common for some time, programs are still struggling to figure out what data is actually useful for athletes and coaches. “Collegiate level coaches are approached all the time with these technology things, I imagine that’s going to bleed down to high school too if it hasn’t already,” she said. “You can get so much information out of it, but the question is what’s relevant, what’s actually tied to performance, what’s tied to future success.” Coaches and company executives told Gizmodo that the biggest driver of the AI analytics boom in youth sports is the prospect that the tools can help athletes make the jump to college, where a spot on a roster can translate into tens of thousands of dollars in scholarships and, at the highest levels, hundreds of thousands of dollars in sponsorship deals. Some products, like SwimIntel, focus purely on recruiting rather than coaching. The platform collects competition data on swimmers as young as 15 and uses it to rank them as recruits and train models that predict how they will fare in different collegiate swim programs. For $40 a month, swimmers can receive 60-plus page analytics reports that project how their times will improve, or worsen, at different colleges. Schools that contract with SwimIntel receive similar predictions in reverse based on how other athletes from the same youth swim club have performed once in college. “We let college coaches play moneyball using AI,” said Jamie Bailey, the founder of SwimIntel. “We let student athletes use AI to find best fits. And in the end, what we’re trying to do is reduce that dropout rate. One out of six college swimmers don’t come back their sophomore year.” Bahr, the former college volleyball coach and data analyst, said that when he worked at programs like Baylor University and Southern Methodist University the volleyball staff would sometimes receive 600 emails a day from prospective recruits. If a player didn’t catch the recruiter’s eye in the first 30 seconds of their highlight reel, they were often passed over. Now with Balltime, more players have access to more video footage than they ever had before and the measurement algorithms have changed the way college programs assess highlight reels. “I don’t even need to watch the film,” Bahr said, recruiters can just look at Balltime’s video analytics to see “are you touching the ball at a height that’s at a better height than our competition? Are you touching the ball over 10 feet or not? We’re already in this insane pressure of hitting these metrics and these tools certainly haven’t helped with that” At the same time, several coaches who spoke to Gizmodo were optimistic that AI video tools will also increase competition in a positive way—by allowing athletes who don’t play for the biggest youth teams to improve their skills and get noticed by recruiters. “Having that video, having those stats, those are real educational tools,” said Pfeiffer, from Michigan State University. “It all comes down to how the athlete is receiving that and making sure appropriate supports are in place. I don’t think these things should be unchecked, they should come with guidance from parents and coaches. But sometimes parents and coaches are overzealous” \\nAiBalltimeDarkhorse AISports  \\r\\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\\r\\n         \\n          Douglas Rushkoff's new book will help you navigate the weird and wild digital world we all live in now, and just might help you survive what's coming.\\n         \\n          Meta's Movie Gen AI video generator can take images of people and turn them into videos, edit existing videos, and even create music and sound effects.\\n         \\n          A California judge has blocked a bill that would punish people who knowingly spread deepfake videos online, saying it’s a threat to free speech.\\n         \\n          OpenAI is now valued at $157 billion.

Now,\\xa0the Mark Zuckerberg-led company has\\xa0Movie Gen, yet another video generator capable of making some realistic-ish video from a short text prompt. Meta claims this is as useful for Hollywood as it is for the average Instagrammer, even though its not available to anyone outside Meta. Movie Gen can create audio, making it\\xa0the most capable deep fake generator we’ve seen yet. In a blog post, Meta showed off a few example videos, including a happy baby hippo swimming underwater, somehow floating just below the surface and apparently having no problems holding its breath. Other videos showcase penguins dressed in “Victorian” outfits with too-short sleeves and skirts to be representative of the time period. There’s another video a woman DJing next to a cheetah who is too distracted by the beat to care about her present danger. Everybody’s getting in on the AI-generated video space. Already this year, Microsoft’s VASA-1 and OpenAI’s Sora promised “realistic” videos generated from simple text prompts. Despite being teased back in February, Sora has yet to see the light of day. Meta’s Movie Gen offers a few more capabilities than the competition, including editing existing video with a text prompt, creating video based on an image, and adding AI-generated sound to the created video. The video editing suite seems especially novel. It works on generated video as well as real-world captures. Meta claims its model “preserves the original content” while adding elements to the footage, whether they’re backdrops or outfits for the scene’s main characters. Meta showed how you can also take pictures of people and drop them into generated movies. Meta already has music and sound generation models, but the social media giant displayed a few examples of the 13B parameter audio generator adding sound effects and soundtracks on top of videos. The text input could be as simple as “rustling leaves and snapping twigs” to add to the generated video of a snake winding along the forest floor. The audio generator is currently limited to 45 seconds, so it won’t score entire movies. At least, it won’t be just yet. And no, sorry, you can’t use it yet. Meta’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, wrote on Threads, “We aren’t ready to release this as a product anytime soon—it’s still expensive, and generation time is too long.”      \\xa0 In its whitepaper discussing Movie Gen, Meta said the whole software suite is made up of multiple foundation models. The largest video model the company has is a 30B parameter transformer model with a maximum context length of 73,000 video tokens. The audio generator is a 13B parameter foundation model that can do both video-to-audio and text-to-audio. It’s hard to compare that to the biggest AI companies’ video generators, especially since OpenAI claims Sora uses “data called patches, each of which is akin to a token in GPT.” Meta is one of the few major companies that still release data with its new AI tools, a practice that has fallen by the wayside as AI has become excessively commercialized. Despite that, Meta’s whitepaper doesn’t offer much of an idea of where it got its training data for Movie Gen. In all likelihood, some part of the data set has come from Facebook users’ videos. Meta also uses the photos you take with the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses to train its AI models. You can’t use Movie Gen yet. Instead, other AI movie generators like RunwayML’s Gen 3 offer a limited number of tokens to create small clips before you need to start paying. A report by 404 Media earlier this year indicated that Runway trained its AI from thousands of YouTube videos, and like most AI startups, it never asked permission before scraping that content. Meta said it worked closely with filmmakers and video producers when creating this model and will continue doing so as it works on Movie Gen. Reports from earlier this year indicate studios are already cozying up to AI companies. Independent darling A24 has recently worked with VC firms specializing in AI, with some tied to OpenAI. On the flip side, Meta is reportedly in talks with Hollywood stars like Judi Dench and Awkwafina about using their voices for future AI projects. \\nAiMETAMeta Movie Gen  \\r\\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\\r\\n         \\n          Douglas Rushkoff's new book will help you navigate the weird and wild digital world we all live in now, and just might help you survive what's coming.\\n         \\n          The Roto VR Explorer for Meta Quest 3 and 3S can make sedentary virtual reality more versatile, but not if you're prone to motion sickness.\\n         \\n          Clubs and high school teams increasingly have access to AI video analysis and predictive analytics that are professionalizing youth sports.\\n         \\n          The Ray-Ban Meta glasses' AI will confidently lie to you about anything, and just like dad, it thinks everything in big red armor is Iron Man.\\n         \\n          A California judge has blocked a bill that would punish people who knowingly spread deepfake videos online, saying it’s a threat to free speech.\\n         \\n          OpenAI is now valued at $157 billion.

Here\\'s how to get the best results.\\n   You likely have multiple questions that pop into your mind throughout the day -- from simple curiosities to existential explorations. Googling is great, but the answers aren\\'t always what you\\'re looking for. You\\'ve got to sift through SEO rankings, ads and common search terms to pick the most appropriate reference.\\xa0 Search results also change with your region, and Google often can\\'t answer specific questions. It presents a lot of information and leaves it up to you to contextualize it all.\\xa0 Enter artificial intelligence, the new \"just Google it.\"  Microsoft\\'s Copilot has access to the internet, so I can chat with it and go through the links it provides whenever I ask it anything. Copilot came out in February 2023 and, like ChatGPT, has been through recent GPT-4o updates.\\xa0 GPT-4 Turbo, the OpenAI model that powers Copilot, is now available with the free version. Copilot Pro is available for $20 per month, but it\\'s not necessary for lightweight daily searching.\\xa0 Here\\'s how to use AI to find answers to your questions and problems. The models are built for question-and-answer.\\xa0 Think of the range of questions and ideas that pop into your mind every day. Questions about weather, geography, historical events, people, movies, health, food and life. Just look at your Google search history if you want to see the possibilities of what you can ask AI.\\xa0 As with all AI tools, the answers are only as clear as the questions you put in. You also need to be aware of errors and a bias to believe what AI produces. It\\'s good practice to always check the sources, especially if you\\'re using the information to make decisions.\\xa0 Asking AI to answer questions is a broad use case, but as you\\'re chatting with Copilot, you\\'ll get a feel for how far to push it.\\xa0 Some answers will be simple and straightforward, while others will require more prodding and context. For example, asking what movies Leonardo DiCaprio is in is different than asking what movies are similar to one you liked that Leo starred in.\\xa0 Copilot gave me DiCaprio\\'s most notable films, but I wanted the full list. I also asked for it without graphics, to keep the conversation clean. It gave me the rest of the (post-2000) list too, and I liked how it bolded the movies with critical acclaim. From there, you can take the conversation in any direction. You could ask if any of your favorites in the list share the same director, request links for reviews and analysis, ask which movie finally earned him an Oscar and see what other movies are similar to the one you love.\\xa0 Copilot also auto-generates follow-up prompt ideas, in case you\\'re in the mood to go down a rabbit hole. Like \"Tell me more about Killers of the Flower Moon,\" \"What awards has Leonardo DiCaprio won?\" and \"Do you have any fun facts about Leonardo DiCaprio?\" The Wolf of Wall Street is a stand-out, so let\\'s use that example to learn more about similar, non-DiCaprio movies. It gave me a pretty good list, but it did feature a movie with DiCaprio   in it even though I specified not to. Dallas Buyers Club, The Big Short and The Social Network were good suggestions with high-stake plots and complex characters.\\xa0 Copilot is handy because it also adds clickable links in the answers -- so you can click to verify yourself that AI hasn\\'t hallucinated (ie, made up the answer by scraping some weird part of the web). You can keep going with the Q&As. I asked Copilot what directors are inspired by Scorsese and it generated a list with two names I recognized: Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan. Looking into their body of work could be ideas for follow-up prompts.\\xa0 You can read more about the art of writing AI prompts for chatbots and image generators on CNET\\'s AI tips page. We all turn to \"Dr. Google\" for health questions. It\\'s not to be relied on, as it often goes straight to anxiety-inducing, worst-case scenarios. While AI is trained on current information across the internet, it might help you narrow in on potential answers to more general health, less individualized questions with a clear prompt, pre-doctor visit.\\xa0 For example, if you\\'re having digestive issues, you might ask Copilot about foods to avoid. You could also use it proactively, like for calculating your ideal daily calorie intake.\\xa0 You could even ask it to provide the latest research or best-ranking articles on a certain health topic or for answers to quick questions, like when women should start getting yearly mammograms, and why you may feel more nauseous around your period. But always double-check AI\\'s advice with your doctor. AI\\'s answers should not be taken as fact or in place of professional medical advice. AI tools are a quick way to get information to help answer your questions. Just like you don\\'t get your answers from the first Google search, the same goes for AI. It\\'s an iterative process, with each prompt getting you closer to clarity. But again, for the final answer, your doctor is the one to consult -- especially as health advice and diagnoses are completely personal and depend on the individual. ...', 'label': 'AIML', 'author': 'Amanda Smith'}, {'id': 6, 'urls': 'https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-find-your-dream-job-using-ai/', 'title': 'How to Find Your Dream Job Using AI', 'brief': 'ChatGPT could help you strategize how and where to find your ideal job.', 'image': 'https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/1c4b3cf740a427e1a6478807bc59eaf31b3b731d/hub/2024/06/18/63a775ed-860b-45f1-92d9-ce3325fc83f6/gettyimages-1303013169.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200', 'content': '\\n    ChatGPT could help you strategize how and where to find your ideal job.\\n   Job hunting?

Just be sure to remove sensitive information you don\\'t want in the AI, such as your contact details to\\xa0avoid any future data breaches\\xa0or unnecessary risk.\\xa0 Prompt: \"Here is my resume. Provide further suggestions.\"\\xa0 This time, it provided (without prompting) advice for enhancing my career, as well as even more detailed suggestions for roles and career paths. But I wanted even more specific direction. Given I\\'ve been a freelancer for 10 years -- working as a reporter for publications and writer for brands -- I wanted to know where ChatGPT thought I\\'d be most successful.\\xa0 I asked: \"What is the strongest part of my resume? Will I have more success applying for reporter or copywriter positions?\"\\xa0 While I have a solid decade of corporate writing experience, ChatGPT knew I\\'d find more fulfillment with a reporter position, particularly cultural criticism. It made suggestions on the strengths and opportunities I\\'d have applying for each kind of role, and it gave an overall recommendation. For even more specificity, I added: \"Joan Didion is my career inspiration.\" In response, ChatGPT inserted a summary of Didion and peppered mentions of her throughout its suggestions of jobs, companies and careers, briefly explaining how they related to her career. Here\\'s part of what it suggested: Next, I scanned through everything ChatGPT had said so far, highlighting the roles or recommendations I liked. Then, I fed it back into ChatGPT and asked it what top companies I should reach out to, adding in where I\\'m based.\\xa0 Prompt: \"I\\'m most interested in roles such as senior journalist, feature writer, cultural critic, head of editorial, editorial director, content director, and chief content officer. What top 30 companies should I target for a new job? I live in the New York City area, but I work remotely.\"\\xa0 It gave me a lot of information, but no new ideas for companies to target. I responded: \"Provide a secondary list of 30 companies that aren\\'t so big and might be easier to get a job at.\" The results were better, with suggestions split into categories for mid-sized and smaller publications, specialized and niche publications, and regional and local Publications. It also gave me strategies on how to apply at those publications, including leveraging my network, showcasing my versatility, writing tailored pitches and emphasizing my portfolio.\\xa0 I picked 10 companies from ChatGPT\\'s list and then asked it to write a message to a recruiter to introduce myself and express my interest.\\xa0 Prompt:\\xa0\"Write a short message to the recruiter at the following five companies to introduce myself and express my interest: Narratively, Longreads, Mother Jones, Salon and The Cut.\" It came back with a pretty generic suggestion, so I pushed ChatGPT further: \"For the Narratively message, remove the generic intro and mention the previous reporting I\\'ve done on the corporatization of LGBTQ+ fertility, expatriatism and cultural fragmentation.\" I tweaked it a bit to sound more natural and like me, which is the version I\\'ll tell ChatGPT to use for the other four messages. Once you have your polished messages, send to the best contact via LinkedIn DM or email -- it might be worth using LinkedIn Premium during your job search.

In fact you may realise the big plot twist was that the goal he was working towards was not the goal he himself had set, but a side distraction to get at a different person. It\\'s interesting how many AI behaviours resemble humans operating unconsciously: Talking at length about subjects I don\\'t understand.Forgetting what I went upstairs to fetch.Copying what I hear everyone say, and calling it me \"thinking\".Getting my facts muddled via associations.Losing any sense of proportionality and common sense.Acting like a brain in a box divorced from normal experiences.Making long pointless lists. That\\'s one take.  My guess was ambiguity over the word \"secure.\"  If the computer is not secure, the connection is not secure.  Securing the computer often involves installing patches. \"It looked around at the system info, decided to upgrade a bunch of stuff including the Linux kernel, got impatient with Apt and so investigated why it was taking so long, then eventually the update succeeded but the machine doesn\\'t have the new kernel so edited my Grub [bootloader] config,\" This sounds like a typical Linux update to me. The agent was just emulating a typical Linux user The description makes no sense. \"decided to upgrade a bunch of stuff including the Linux kernel\" vs \" update succeeded but the machine doesn\\'t have the new kernel\". What does that mean? I\\'ve never heard of a \"successful\" kernel upgrade ending up with no new kernel. And this: \"so edited my Grub [bootloader] config,\" is it implying that apt didn\\'t do an \"update-grub\" like it normally does so the AI manually edited it? Whole thing\\'s as clear as mud. If you\\'ve never had a kernel upgrade partially fail and as a result not update Grub (or Lilo), then you haven\\'t been using Linux very long. But they said the upgrade *succeeded*. Obviously if it *had* partially failed then grub might not get updated. (BTW I\\'ve been running Linux for 16 years.) https://xkcd.com/416/ [xkcd.com] This is nothing.

The fictional Carrie Bradshaw said it best: In New York, you\\'re always looking for a job, a boyfriend or an apartment.\\xa0 While I\\'m not looking for a job, as a freelancer, I\\'m always looking for the next jobs. My wife and some friends are on the job hunt, too -- so I\\'ve got some good insights to draw from.\\xa0 Their biggest pain point? Getting bumped off LinkedIn\\'s job hunting section and being forced to sign up to companies\\' separate hiring portals. But while the Easy Apply button isn\\'t always easy, there are other tools that can make the job search and unemployment process more manageable. With the wave of artificial intelligence, it\\'s never been easier to add something surprising to your resume.\\xa0 The goal: to be a delightful respite for hiring managers reviewing resumes, making it easier to get a foot in the door.\\xa0 I\\'d heard about Canva\\'s new AI capabilities, so I wanted to test them out. Canva is a graphic design platform with tools and templates that anyone can use. The Australian company launched in 2013, but its AI suite, Magic Studio, became available to users in October 2023.\\xa0 With Magic Studio, you can create AI-powered designs, presentations, videos, animations and more. There are three different Canva plans --\\xa0free, pro or teams. Some of the AI features are only available on pro or teams plans, which range from $100-$120 per year. In the free version, it specifies \"AI-generated writing and designs\" and in the pro version, it lists \"20+ AI tools\" as part of its offerings. I wanted to use AI to personalize my job application, to show there\\'s a real human behind it and to showcase my thinking, experience and achievements. (And for more ways to use AI in your hunt for a job, check out these seven techniques we\\'ve tried and how they work.) I had an idea. To avoid being reactive and simply applying to jobs, I wanted to create a short showreel of myself and my work that I could also DM recruiters and share on social media.\\xa0 I decided to create a 60-day campaign where I share it somewhere online once a day to get eyeballs on my profile, have more direct conversations and showcase my creativity. This strategy can be applied to any industry – just tweak the asset, approach and audience.\\xa0 A five-day plan could be:\\xa0 1. Add the reel to your cover letter and resume.2. Write a post and share the reel.3. Link the reel to the Featured section in LinkedIn.4. DM a recruiter or potential employer and link the reel.\\xa05. Comment on a post of an employee who works at a target company and link out to it. Before jumping into Canva, I asked ChatGPT what I should put in my video resume. It gave me some hints. Namely, keep it short and focused; plan your script out to cover an intro, key achievements, skills and expertise; film it with a professional background; include visual assets to support what you\\'re talking about; tailor the video to your audience; and end with a personal message and a call to reach out. Of course, I could have used ChatGPT to draft the script for the showreel, but given its importance, I didn\\'t want to outsource the thinking or words to AI. The key was not giving too much away and for it not to feel like a needy \"hire me\" ad. Less marketing, more movie trailer feel.\\xa0 First, I compiled my bio/elevator pitch, a couple of photos and my favorite work clips, then jumped into Canva\\'s Magic Studio. Next, I gave Canva some context on what I planned to use this video for, to help it generate a design.\\xa0 I didn\\'t like the text it generated, and it cut off a lot of the important parts of my work samples, like headlines and brand or publication names, so I had to do some tweaking. It also had a hard time matching up the right text with the corresponding picture. This slide/story below was for my work in National Geographic, but it failed to mention that. I knew I wanted to use my bio, but I was curious how Canva would describe me from the text I fed it. \"I\\'m a creative and experienced professional with a passion for storytelling.\" Canva, we can do better than that.\\xa0 I pulled key lines from my bio, as I was keen on keeping the video short. You can pull these from your LinkedIn or ask ChatGPT to pinpoint the top seven to 10 selling points from your resume.\\xa0 Here\\'s mine: I lengthened the time on each slide slightly (from 4 to 5 seconds) to give people more time to read each sentence. I also changed the animation of each slide to my liking. It probably took me an hour to upload and modify in Canva.\\xa0 To download it without the watermark, I would have needed to upgrade to Canva Pro. It\\'s worth it to avoid looking sloppy to potential clients or employers, but for my experiment, I downloaded my video\\xa0via the free version.\\xa0 What it produced was passable and functional. Did I need AI to make it? Given I changed a lot of what it initially provided, probably not.\\xa0 Will I be winning an Academy Award for this clip? Definitely not.\\xa0 Will I win over recruiters or hirers? Maybe.\\xa0 ...', 'label': 'AIML', 'author': 'Amanda Smith'}, {'id': 9, 'urls': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-new-iphone-se-with-ai-could-help-china-sales-2024-10', 'title': 'A less-expensive iPhone that still has AI features could help Apple out in China', 'brief': 'A reported new iPhone SE featuring Apple Intelligence could offer a more affordable alternative to iPhone 15 and 16 and boost sales in China.', 'image': 'https://i.insider.com/66fd79209e0c5c2eeeea1171?width=1200&format=jpeg', 'content': 'Consumers will reportedly soon be able to get Apple Intelligence at a more affordable price. That could give the tech giant a sales boost in a key market where it\\'s been struggling against increased competition: China. Bloomberg correspondent Mark Gurman wrote that a new iteration of the iPhone SE is in the works for early 2025, according to people familiar with the project, and will have Apple\\'s long-anticipated AI features. As it stands, only those who own an iPhone 15 Pro or later will have Apple Intelligence on their phones when it begins rolling out later this month. The 15 Pro starts at $899, while the new iPhone 16 starts at $799. The current iPhone SE costs $429; it\\'s also smaller than these newer models. While Bloomberg didn\\'t say what the forthcoming SE might cost, an AI-powered phone at a lower price point than iPhone 15 or 16 models has the potential to boost sales in regions where Apple has faced headwinds, like Greater China, analysts told Business Insider. Apple has been struggling in the region, partly because of competition from domestic smartphone makers. Huawei, for example, has seen much success from the Mate 60 Pro and Pura 70 Ultra releases in 2024. Sales in the nine months through August 1 fell almost 10% in Greater China. But \"by offering affordability coupled with Apple Intelligence features, the tech giant could reignite interest among cost-conscious consumers,\" Jacob Bourne, a tech analyst at BI sister company Emarketer, said. Still, Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, called China Apple\\'s \"big unanswered question when it comes to Apple Intelligence.\" Munster said addressing that issue relies on the company\\'s ability to partner with a Chinese company to bring AI features to the region and \"getting the price right.\" But generally, an iPhone with AI at a lower price point would allow US consumers to test Apple Intelligence features without spending close to $1,000 on an upgrade, Munster said. The new iPhone SE 3 will also get a new look, Bloomberg reported. Unlike the current iPhone SE 3, which was released in 2022, it won\\'t have a home button but will feature the edge-to-edge screen design that Apple has become known for. Instead of looking like an iPhone 8, the upcoming device will resemble an iPhone 14, Bloomberg said.

In today\\'s big story, Google Search is going to look a whole lot different thanks to generative AI. What\\'s on deck: But first, Search will never be the same (again). If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One down. One to go. The internet\\'s most popular tool is getting a facelift thanks to AI. Google is rolling out a series of generative AI-powered changes to Search, writes Business Insider\\'s Hugh Langley. It shows Big Tech\\'s continued push to leverage AI wherever possible, and the constant evolution of how people consume the internet. The biggest adjustment is to Search\\'s layout, Hugh writes. That includes AI organizing page results into different categories, and highlighting different videos, forum links, and widgets. Goodbye, pages of blue links. According to Rhiannon Bell, the vice president of user experience for Google Search, it\\'s a \"pretty dramatic shift from where we were before.\" There are still a lot of caveats to the rollout — it\\'ll only activate for recipe-related questions initially and will be featured just on mobile — but it\\'s clearly the direction Google is taking its all-powerful tool. And yes, in case you were wondering if it was coming, Google is going to start putting ads in its AI Search results — but only when Google deems them relevant. Search\\'s revamp addresses a big concern for the rest of the internet. Google will include hyperlinks directly into AI Overview results, which means more traffic for websites it\\'s sourcing information from, it says. During the initial rollout of AI Overview, a major concern was whether it marked the end of the firehose of traffic Search sends websites. Why bother going to a site if I can get the answer directly from Search? But there\\'s a bigger question of whether people want to get to the source at all. Gen Z, which was raised on curation and aggregation, has fully bought into just getting the highlights. When it comes to a video or a story, they\\'re heading straight to the comments to get the tea. Google probably doesn\\'t mind you staying only on its site. Remember: \"Google will do the Googling for you.\" And it\\'s not wrong. One survey conducted earlier this year found 60% of people who used Google\\'s AI search found it more effective than non-AI powered Search. (To be sure, the bar wasn\\'t that high.)

During a virtual roundtable, we asked Business Insider\\'s Workforce Innovation board to tell us how AI would transform companies over the next year. One major topic was reskilling and upskilling employees. BI\\'s Tim Paradis, who focuses on the future of work, asked whether there were any fears that dire predictions of AI outpacing human capabilities to learn, like those advanced in a recent article by Sun Microsystems cofounder Vinod Khosla, would prove true. \"The basic drivers of job creation will change with a technology that does not only augment human capabilities, but also may surpass them altogether,\" Khosla wrote, \"leaving education and upskilling — a historical avenue for retraining and relevance — somewhat impotent.\" Board members rejected the grim prognostication. \"I disagree with that statement,\" said Justina Nixon-Saintil, IBM\\'s vice president and chief impact officer, though she agreed that AI would exacerbate the digital divide. \"We made a commitment to scale 2 million people in AI by 2026,\" Nixon-Saintil said. \"There\\'s a sense of urgency in making sure we are not leaving people behind.\" AARP\\'s Marjorie Powell argued that the global labor shortage was evidence of an enduring need for human workers but that no one can afford to be complacent. \"You\\'re going to have to relearn how to do your job,\" Powell said. Others described the importance of communicating clearly with workers about what AI means for their jobs now and in the future. \"We\\'re trying to figure out how this transformation is going to occur,\" said Chris Deri, the president of the corporate advisory businesses at Weber Shandwick. \"There has to be transparent communications and stakeholder engagement alongside figuring out these enterprise and strategic matters.\" The following has been edited for length and clarity. A lot is going to change. Any tasks or jobs in the company that could be automated by AI will happen within the next year. For any jobs that cannot be automated, workers will need to understand how to work alongside AI. You need to understand what AI means for your role, how to use it to increase productivity or efficiency, and how to create new products and solutions leveraging AI. That\\'s going to be the big shift, and here we actually continue to upskill our employees to prepare for that shift. Last year, we had an AI challenge across the company, and a huge percentage of our employees participated. They had to get training first, and then they were part of a team to come up with innovative solutions leveraging AI. We did it again this summer. So the company is very focused on how to upskill all employees, because it\\'s going to impact every role in the company. We have two objectives. One is to become an AI-first enterprise. The first task is to see how we can start using AI in everything we do, whether it\\'s in our claims or travel expenses, procurement, or handling invoices. Our philosophy is very simple. AI is not about replacing an individual or replacing an employee but how we can amplify our productivity by using the tools. How can we eat our own dog food right before we start telling customers to adopt AI? Second is that for all the offerings that we have today, we want to make sure we infuse AI into them. When we go and talk to our customers about task-level automation, coding or developing an application, or migrating a workload into the cloud — how can we infuse AI into everything that we do? So it doesn\\'t just become a people-based offering but a people-plus-AI-based offering. We believe there\\'s going to be a greater emphasis on upskilling and reskilling alongside AI technologies. It\\'s important that everyone learns how to deal with prompt engineering; we are not going to hire prompt engineers. It\\'s going to become a skill for employees to craft clear and specific prompts, adjust to the right audience, and utilize elements and problem-solving skills to identify inaccurate responses. It\\'s about adaptability. Employees are going to have to be open to continuous learning and adapting to new AI tools and technologies in their jobs. So we make sure we\\'re providing some kind of atmosphere and culture for being excited and energetic about learning. The workforce will have to problem-solve regardless of the tool and the technology, and it will require test-and-learn approaches. We created a \"community of practice\" in the company where individuals can join and help with peer learning and have a sandbox to play around with AI, depending on where they are. They can cross-pollinate across business-unit lines, and that has become very exciting. We also use that group to pilot the new technologies we\\'re considering rolling out to the company. Data literacy is going to be very important — understanding how to read and interpret and tell a story of the data. We\\'re also developing power users in the company, people who are really, really good at this that other employees can tap into when they need help. We have 35,000 employees, and north of 70% are active users of generative AI now. We\\'ve taken a full-company approach of upskilling and rolling out both custom and off-the-shelf tools, regardless of the job. The bottom-up innovation power of gen AI is super exciting. For example, our teams and employees have created more than a thousand custom GPTs, mini automation machines, to-do scripts, and dashboards to create bespoke analyses and build newsletters — it\\'s super quick, and it doesn\\'t require big investments or processes. That\\'s one thing that\\'s specific to gen AI versus other types of technology innovation — it\\'s sparking a lot of energy and unlocking human capacity. Gen AI also offers an opportunity to avoid leakage of human capital, which obviously we all care quite a lot about. It really changes the game in terms of the amount of learning you can keep within the team and not lose as people move around. We\\'re also seeing how gen AI is creating an exoskeleton for generalists to be able to take on more technical tasks. It\\'s not going to turn a generalist analyst into an expert coder, but actually our analysis would show that they can get 80%-plus there on some coding tasks, which then you still need the expert coder to do quality control. We\\'re trying to infuse AI in all our externally facing products and solutions to make them more insightful, intuitive, and delightful to use — and, in many ways, to create experiences that mimic what a personalized human experience might be like, but at scale. We also see most roles and workflows becoming augmented with AI. That\\'s becoming more and more obvious as the months go on and as teams engage with AI and find applications and new ways of working. I was at Dreamforce recently in San Francisco. What Salesforce unveiled was how it wants to help companies essentially launch AI agents in sales, customer service, marketing, and commerce. For many companies to get the full power of what AI can do, you have to be able to link up lots of different datasets that are usually in disparate places. It\\'s hard work, and it\\'s very time-consuming. To hear the stories of companies being like, \"Guess what, you don\\'t actually have to move that data around anymore,\" this is going to change how a lot of companies experiment and start to play with AI-oriented applications that will fundamentally change their operations. There are a lot of companies out there that have already started to light it up. We\\'re thinking a lot about how sales, customer service, marketing, and product have operated for a long time in various silos. When you think about customer experiences, they really shouldn\\'t be that way. They should be much more integrated than they are today. Some of these technologies can be part of the accelerants for how customer experiences can be reimagined. Part of what\\'s been hard for people is like, \"OK, but do I have to get all of these disparate parts of my company to all work together in a new way? Do I have to build this huge team of AI engineers?\" The answer is no. You don\\'t have to be the tip of the spear in terms of sophistication. At Clear Capital, we participate in the highly regulated housing-finance industry. To enable AI to be used in accordance with our clients\\' expectations of governance and quality control, we\\'ve taken a three-pronged approach. First, we\\'ve been investing in creating good industry standards and working with the industry to ensure there\\'s agreement on how AI models should be tested, how they ensure compliance with antidiscrimination and fairness practices, and how the data should be handled. Second, we\\'ve been investing a lot in higher-quality data. As AI accelerates, you also have to accelerate the handling of data in a way that can produce accurate models. So we\\'ve invested quite a bit in better digitization and generation of data. Third is fostering collaboration between innovators, industry players, policymakers, and regulators. We participated this year in the Federal Housing Finance Agency\\'s generative-AI tech sprint, where about 80 leaders from different aspects of the housing industry brainstormed ways to apply generative AI to the lending process to improve borrowers\\' experience. One thing that became clear after participating in that was where we have more tools and more capabilities to accelerate. We always have to go back to the why: What is the mission? And we have to make the mission at the company level that much more clear so that as we apply these new tools, it\\'s always for the sake of the mission. We\\'re a public-relations firm, so we\\'re looking at AI for ourselves and for our clients. In terms of our own people, one lesson we\\'ve already learned is that there was an instinct to take a top-down approach, as in everybody\\'s got to figure out how AI is going to change their business, but we need to take a bottom-up approach. In the simplest sense, we do consumer marketing, healthcare marketing, and corporate advisory work. We really need to design training for each of the different practitioner types. There\\'s a mega-trend need for all of us to adopt AI and understand it, but that means something different for different parts of our organization. Another thing we\\'re doing is creating a futuristic think-tank group in our company — three or four people who have been putting together an ecosystem to give us constant learning. We also have academic institutions, investors, technologists, and other practitioners to help. We\\'re also looking at our business model and how we budget and scope. The classic assignment we get is companies call us and say, \"We want to map our stakeholders and what their expectations are of us.\" That used to be a project that we would figure out with just consultant time. Now we\\'re applying AI to do some of that. We need to figure out how to take advantage of those efficiencies to add new value — that human value. So we need to relook at our entire business and service model, and we haven\\'t figured it all out yet. Anant talked about \"eating your own dog food.\" We\\'ve mapped out the implementation of that stack for ourselves to test and learn, and then we will start to use that in how we show up as advisors to our clients on the same journey. We\\'re thinking a lot about the AI trust gap. I\\'m in San Francisco today, and I was walking around and I saw all these autonomous vehicles, and it dawned on me that my mother would never ride in one. She just does not trust that technology. As a data company, we\\'re thinking a lot about how do we ensure that our customers, our clients, and our partners trust that we\\'re going to protect their data and use AI when appropriate and be certain that we have safeguards for when it isn\\'t appropriate. And then I think the biggest area that my team is focused on with this trust gap is job security and what this means for the average worker. So what we\\'re trying to do is really keep people at the center of this transformation. We\\'re thinking a lot about employee resource groups. That way we\\'ve been able to reach all different types of team members. So how do we target our ERGs and think about who are the slow adapters? Who are the folks that typically get left behind, and how do we give them a little extra push? What we want to do is think about how to continue to have our team members trust their leaders, but also trust AI and where we\\'re going, and get them to understand this isn\\'t about replacing jobs. We are really focused on transforming jobs. That is a huge shift and a huge opportunity for us. There are a lot of different points of view on what AI will and will not do and how quickly. I was reading an article in The Wall Street Journal over the weekend that said for every one person who believes that AI is going to replace everyone\\'s jobs, there are three or four who think there\\'s going to be this boom in AI and then it\\'s going to settle down. And that the promise we think AI is going to deliver will probably take longer than we think to come to fruition. One of the things that we\\'ve been doing at Ancestry very intentionally is bringing up the subject of governance, because I think we all think of AI as this steamroller that\\'s going to come and either we\\'re going to step aside from it or we\\'re going to get steamrolled. The more people we get thinking about governance, the better AI technology will be used. And I say that within Ancestry as well as within companies in general and within governments. We have more of a role to play in how this rolls out than we think. We\\'ve been building AI into our product for over 10 years now, and we\\'ve been giving more thought to how would we govern the use of AI within our own company so that we\\'re not, for example, putting our customers\\' data at risk. We\\'re very conscious that security and privacy is first and foremost in every discussion. It\\'s really about how you govern such an amazing technology.

Read it now. In this article: BERLIN — The debate over AI’s impact on art is hitting dance floors in Berlin, where DJ veteran Christian Becker keeps the crowd grooving at a trendy bar, manually transitioning between indie throwbacks and electronic tracks. Within the city’s iconic and diverse club scene — best known globally for its techno culture and industrial raves — the reception and adoption of AI among professional DJs is mixed. Some find the tools harmless and helpful, while others question whether AI has a place in the DJ booth. It’s part of a broader debate among artists, musicians, filmmakers, and authors on what role the technology should have, if any, in the creative process. “It wouldn’t work,” Becker, a 33-year-veteran and co-owner of Bohnengold in the buzzy Kreuzberg district, said while taking a break from his set on a recent Saturday night. “Because you’re connecting with the people … you have to watch the people, how they dance.” Software companies that make DJing platforms are increasingly adding AI capabilities, giving DJs the option to automate tasks they normally do themselves, like choosing songs or mixing and transitioning tracks. “There is always pushback from the purists and the guys who want to hold onto the past,” said Angelo Tun, a world scratch DJ champion and the head of brand at Algoriddim, a Munich-based DJ software company leaning heavily into AI. “It started with vinyl. They were against digital tools. Innovation is happening in every industry now.” In this article: Algoriddim updated its popular software Djay Pro this summer, making it easier to automate song transitions by adjusting the vocal and instrumental levels of different tracks. Rekordbox, another popular software, can now automatically set a song’s cue points — specific points in a song that a DJ might want to skip to. René Noé, also known as DJ Grzly Adams, is a fan of an AI function first created by Algoriddim that allows DJs to separate layers of a song in real time, isolating the acapella vocals or instrumental beat of a song. He also uses a feature on Djay Pro that suggests songs from his library based on whether it fits what he’s currently playing. “I’d rather listen to a good mix from a software than a bad mix from a DJ,” Noé said. While Benedict Faber, one half of Berlin-based electronic music and DJ duo Kon Faber, sees some benefit in using AI, he said too much loses the artistry. DJing is full of choices, and “the more choices you outsource, the more you give away what is unique about you as an artist,” he said. Some patrons at Bohnengold didn’t care whether the DJ was human or a bot, so long as the set had a good vibe, while others preferred to see a live person in the DJ booth. Solu Fida, a 24-year-old Berlin native, said she appreciates a good live DJ set, so “you can see when the DJ has a good crowd and feels, and maybe spontaneously makes changes and stuff.” DJing is a form of live, performance-based art, and good DJs know how to read a room. It’s a deeply human skill and it remains, for lack of a better term, a vibes-based art. Software can’t fully replace vibes. AI tools lower the barrier to entry for DJing, but I don’t think they’ll make live DJs obsolete any time soon. I played around with Djay Pro and its AI tools, and I’m nowhere close to being able to even DJ the Semafor holiday party. For smaller bars or lower-budget parties or events, AI DJs could replace their need to hire a human one. “The DJs might become obsolete, because the software is becoming that good,” Noé said.

The company emphasized that Apple\\'s Vision Pro may be heading in the wrong direction. Bloomberg tech analyst Mark Gurman noted Apple\\'s realization that its headset design needs reconsideration, though no consensus has been reached internally. Meanwhile, Meta\\'s AR glasses development appears to be progressing faster than Apple’s lab efforts. Apple evaluates 5 potential product roadmaps for Vision Pro development Apple is evaluating five potential development paths for Vision Pro, according to Gurman. These include maintaining the current direction, developing a smart display, creating smart glasses, integrating AI with AirPods, and launching standalone AR glasses. This assessment reflects Apple\\'s broader efforts to optimize the Vision Pro for diverse markets. The \"maintain the current strategy\" approach involves continuing the current Vision Pro development while releasing a more budget-friendly version. This could be achieved through using cheaper materials, simplified internal components, and lower-resolution displays, helping to reduce production costs. The \"smart display\" approach suggests removing the Vision Pro\\'s internal computer and external battery, and transferring these functions to the iPhone. This would reduce the Vision Pro\\'s weight and heat output while lowering production costs, potentially resulting in a more affordable price. The \"smart glasses\" approach involves Apple exploring glasses similar to Meta\\'s Ray-Ban model, without AR capabilities. Leveraging its expertise in chips, audio, and AI, Apple aims to design an appealing and innovative smart glasses device. The \"AI and AirPods\" approach involves Apple working on a new AirPods Pro model featuring external cameras and AI to understand the environment and provide user feedback. While similar to a smart glasses concept, this product doesn’t include an actual glasses design. The ultimate approach envisions a standalone AR device with high-performance lenses, a built-in computer, a battery system, cameras, and eye-tracking technology, all within a regular glasses form factor. Gurman noted this has been a longtime dream of CEO Tim Cook, though development faced earlier challenges. Price, concept, and product positioning: Still lacking consumer appeal The Vision Pro faces significant challenges, serving more as a tech showcase than a mainstream consumer product. Consumers don\\'t see a compelling need to buy it, with issues like discomfort during long wear, limited third-party apps, and lack of standout features. Whether marketed as a mixed reality (MR) or spatial computing device, the Vision Pro has yet to resonate with consumers. Gurman also argues that the Vision Pro\\'s US$3,500 price tag is too high compared to Meta\\'s products. Even with a US$500 or US$1,000 reduction, it\\'s unlikely to drive significant sales, as it would lead to reduced profits for only a slight increase in market share. The Vision Pro costs more than 10 times the price of Meta\\'s entry-level Quest products, with the Quest 3S starting at just US$299. This makes Meta better positioned to mainstream MR. The Quest 3S, priced for gifting or immersive movie and gaming experiences, is far more accessible than Apple\\'s Vision Pro.

The fund, which is the second-largest tokenized fund on the market with a $435 million market cap, is already available on Ethereum via Arbitrum, Stellar and Polygon as well as Avalanche. Franklin’s latest addition is due to Aptos’ unique characteristics which also meet the asset manager’s rigorous suitability standards for its Benji platform, the firm’s blockchain-integrated recordkeeping system, said Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton. One Benji token represents one share of the fund. Aptos is a fairly young Layer 1 blockchain launched in 2022. It employs the Move programming language, which it claims allows for faster and more protected transactions. Aptos Labs, the developers behind the blockchain, have long made it their mission to bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and large, traditional institutions, as have other Layer 1 blockchains. In April, the firm started partnering with Microsoft and Brevan Howard, as well as South Korean telecommunications operator SK Telecom to help institutions make it easier to experiment in decentralized finance. “Franklin Templeton’s willingness to innovate in the name of a truly decentralized and accessible financial future is inspiring,” said Bashar Lazaar, Head of Grants and Ecosystem at Aptos Foundation. “To reach that future, we need to connect not just the TradFi and DeFi worlds, but EVM and non-EVM networks as well. Integrating the Benji Investments platform with the Aptos Network is a massive step in the right direction and we look forward to welcoming them to the Aptos ecosystem,” he said.

While its primary function as a decentralized digital asset has garnered attention, its potential to address economic inequality is equally noteworthy. By offering an alternative to traditional banking systems and promoting financial inclusion, blockchain currency is gradually leveling the economic playing field. This article explores how blockchain currency can reduce economic inequality and create opportunities for underserved communities worldwide. \\xa0 Empowering the Unbanked \\xa0 Financial Access for All \\xa0 One of the most significant challenges in addressing economic inequality is the lack of access to financial services. According to the World Bank, nearly 1.7 billion adults worldwide are unbanked, meaning they do not have access to a bank account or any formal financial institution. This exclusion often perpetuates poverty, as individuals without access to banking services struggle to save money, obtain credit, or engage in economic activities. Blockchain currency provides a viable solution by enabling financial transactions without the need for traditional banks. With just a smartphone and internet connection, individuals can create a digital wallet, store assets, and make transactions. This accessibility is particularly beneficial in developing regions where banking infrastructure is limited or non-existent. You can also explore Eclipse Earn for further information. \\xa0 Lower Transaction Costs \\xa0 Traditional financial systems often burden users with high transaction fees, particularly for cross-border payments. These fees can be prohibitive for low-income individuals and small businesses, further exacerbating economic inequality. Blockchain technology, however, facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, significantly reducing transaction costs. \\xa0 Lower fees mean that more of the money sent by migrant workers, for instance, reaches their families back home. This not only improves the financial well-being of recipients but also stimulates local economies, contributing to a reduction in poverty levels. \\xa0 Promoting Economic Inclusion \\xa0 Democratizing Investment Opportunities \\xa0 Investment opportunities have historically been reserved for the wealthy, with high entry barriers preventing lower-income individuals from participating in wealth-building activities. Blockchain currency is changing this dynamic by democratizing access to investment platforms. Through tokenization, assets such as real estate, art, or commodities can be divided into smaller units and traded on blockchain platforms. This allows individuals with limited capital to invest in assets they would otherwise be unable to afford. By lowering the barriers to entry, blockchain currency enables a broader segment of the population to participate in wealth creation, thereby narrowing the wealth gap and promoting economic inclusion. \\xa0 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Solutions \\xa0 Decentralized finance (DeFi) is another area where blockchain technology is making a significant impact on economic inequality. DeFi platforms offer financial services such as lending, borrowing, and earning interest, all without the need for traditional banks. These platforms operate on blockchain networks, ensuring transparency, security, and accessibility. \\xa0 For individuals in countries with unstable or corrupt financial systems, DeFi provides an alternative means of accessing financial services. Users can engage in lending and borrowing activities, earn interest on their assets, and even take out loans without the need for a credit check. This empowers individuals who have been excluded from traditional financial systems due to lack of credit history or other barriers. \\xa0 Enhancing Transparency and Reducing Corruption \\xa0 Transparent Transactions \\xa0 Corruption is a major contributor to economic inequality, particularly in developing countries where funds meant for public services are often siphoned off by corrupt officials. Blockchain technology's inherent transparency offers a solution to this problem. Every transaction made on a blockchain is recorded on a public ledger, which is immutable and accessible to anyone. This transparency reduces the likelihood of funds being misappropriated and ensures that financial resources reach their intended recipients. For example, governments can use blockchain technology to distribute social welfare benefits, ensuring that funds are delivered directly to the intended beneficiaries without any intermediaries. This can help reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations. \\xa0 Reducing Barriers to Entry for Entrepreneurs \\xa0 Entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic growth and job creation, yet many aspiring entrepreneurs face significant barriers to entry, including lack of access to capital and bureaucratic red tape. Blockchain technology can help remove these barriers by providing a platform for fundraising and business development. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Security Token Offerings (STOs) are examples of how blockchain technology is revolutionizing fundraising for startups. These methods allow entrepreneurs to raise capital from a global pool of investors without the need for traditional venture capital firms or banks. By reducing reliance on traditional financial institutions, blockchain currency empowers entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds to launch and grow their businesses, contributing to economic growth and job creation. \\xa0 Conclusion \\xa0 The role of blockchain currency in reducing economic inequality cannot be overstated. By providing financial access to the unbanked, lowering transaction costs, democratizing investment opportunities, and enhancing transparency, blockchain technology is creating a more inclusive global economy. As adoption of this technology continues to grow, it has the potential to significantly narrow the wealth gap and promote economic equality on a global scale. The transformative power of blockchain currency lies in its ability to empower individuals, particularly those who have been historically marginalized, to participate in the global economy and improve their economic well-being. \\xa0 How to comment •\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Don't insult other visitors.

As digital technology increasingly influences various aspects of our lives, it’s no surprise that it’s also reshaping how we approach elections. Among the technological advancements, blockchain technology stands out as a promising solution to enhance transparency, security, and trust in electoral systems. This article explores how blockchain can transform elections by ensuring transparency and integrity, thereby restoring public confidence in the democratic process. \\xa0 Understanding Blockchain Technology \\xa0 Why Blockchain is Relevant to Elections \\xa0 The relevance of blockchain to elections lies in its ability to provide a secure and transparent method of recording votes. Traditional voting systems, whether paper-based or electronic, are susceptible to various forms of tampering, fraud, and human error. Blockchain technology, however, can address these issues by offering a system that is tamper-resistant, transparent, and verifiable by all stakeholders. \\xa0 How Blockchain Enhances Election Transparency \\xa0 Securing the Voting Process \\xa0 One of the main advantages of blockchain technology in elections is its ability to secure the voting process. Since each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, it is nearly impossible for malicious actors to alter or delete votes without being detected. This ensures that the outcome of the election accurately reflects the will of the voters, free from external manipulation. You can also explore wealth catalyst ai for further information. \\xa0 Ensuring Transparency \\xa0 Transparency is another critical aspect of fair elections, and blockchain excels in this area. With blockchain, each vote is recorded on a public ledger that can be audited by anyone with access. This means that voters, election officials, and even independent observers can verify that the votes have been counted correctly. This level of transparency can significantly reduce the chances of electoral fraud and increase trust in the electoral process. \\xa0 Enhancing Voter Confidence \\xa0 When voters are confident that their votes will be accurately counted and that the election process is transparent, they are more likely to participate in elections. Blockchain technology can enhance voter confidence by providing a clear, unalterable record of each vote. This assurance can lead to higher voter turnout and a more robust democratic process. \\xa0 Potential Challenges and Solutions \\xa0 Technical Challenges \\xa0 While blockchain holds great promise for enhancing transparency in elections, it is not without its challenges. One of the primary technical challenges is the scalability of blockchain networks. Elections involve millions of votes, and the blockchain must be able to handle this volume without slowing down or crashing. \\xa0 Addressing Scalability \\xa0 To address scalability concerns, some experts suggest using a hybrid approach that combines blockchain with traditional databases. In this model, the blockchain would handle the most critical parts of the election process, such as recording and verifying votes, while less critical data could be stored on traditional databases. This approach could help balance the need for transparency with the technical limitations of blockchain technology. \\xa0 Regulatory and Legal Challenges \\xa0 Another significant challenge is the regulatory and legal framework surrounding the use of blockchain in elections. Many countries have strict regulations regarding how elections are conducted, and integrating a new technology like blockchain would require changes to existing laws and regulations. \\xa0 Navigating Legal Frameworks \\xa0 To overcome these challenges, governments and regulatory bodies must work closely with blockchain experts to develop a legal framework that supports the use of blockchain in elections. This framework should address issues such as data privacy, voter anonymity, and the legality of blockchain-based voting systems. By creating a supportive legal environment, countries can more easily adopt blockchain technology in their electoral processes. \\xa0 Real-World Applications and Success Stories \\xa0 Estonia's E-Voting System \\xa0 Estonia is one of the few countries that have successfully integrated blockchain into its voting system. The country’s e-voting system, which has been in use since 2005, relies on blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and transparency of the voting process. Estonia’s success demonstrates that blockchain can be effectively used in national elections, providing a model for other countries to follow. \\xa0 Other Pilot Projects \\xa0 Several other countries, including the United States, Switzerland, and South Korea, have conducted pilot projects to test the feasibility of using blockchain in elections. These projects have shown promising results, indicating that blockchain could play a significant role in future elections worldwide. \\xa0 Conclusion \\xa0 Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way elections are conducted by enhancing transparency, security, and voter confidence. While there are challenges to be addressed, the benefits of using blockchain in elections are clear. As more countries explore and adopt this technology, we can expect to see a significant shift towards more transparent and trustworthy electoral processes. The future of democracy may very well depend on how effectively we can integrate blockchain into our voting systems, ensuring that every vote is counted and every voice is heard. \\xa0 How to comment •\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Don't insult other visitors.

Last month the Indian government launched the Vishvasya-Blockchain Technology Stack, that would offer blockchain-as-a-service, the intention being to make governance more transparent, efficient, and accountable.  The government’s initiative will simplify the integration of blockchain technology into various applications, says Sharat Chandra, a blockchain and emerging tech evangelist.  Instances of data breaches and personal information of citizens floating around in the dark web is worrying for people. “While Aadhaar provides identity verification, Vishvasya can ensure that the data associated with those identities is immutable and tamper-proof,” Chandra told businessline in an email interview, where he spoke about CBDCs leveraging blockchain tech, the potential of tokenisation in industry and distributed ledger technologies.  Chandra is working with a few state government-affiliated entities on establishing token standards for land records, with the goal of facilitating seamless transfers of land ownership and Transfer of Development Rights. He was also involved in shaping the National Strategy on Blockchain by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) in 2021. The Vishvasya stack is designed as a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform, which means it simplifies the integration of blockchain technology into various applications for state governments such as Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Bihar and Karnataka which have blockchain projects underway and are leading in blockchain adoption. By complementing existing frameworks like Aadhaar and Digilocker, Vishvasya enhances security, transparency, and efficiency in public service delivery. For instance, while Aadhaar provides identity verification, Vishvasya can ensure that the data associated with those identities is immutable and tamper-proof. This synergy allows for a more robust digital infrastructure where services can be delivered securely and efficiently across sectors like healthcare, education, and governance. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are poised to significantly benefit from blockchain technology. By leveraging programmability, quantum resistant cryptography and on-chain settlement, CBDCs can enhance transaction speed and security, especially for cross-border payments. Blockchain allows for real-time settlement of transactions, which can drastically reduce costs associated with traditional systems like SWIFT. While it’s highly unlikely that CBDCs will completely replace SWIFT in the immediate future, they could serve as a complementary system that offers faster and more transparent transactions globally. Tokenisation has immense potential across various industries, but I believe real estate and financial assets such as bonds, money market funds, private equity and government securities are likely to lead the charge. These sectors have traditionally faced liquidity challenges, and tokenisation can democratise access by allowing fractional ownership. However, regulatory frameworks are crucial here. While we’re making progress, ongoing dialogue between regulators and industry stakeholders will be key to navigating this evolving landscape. In the long term, I see Distributed Ledger Technologies becoming integral to our financial market infrastructure in several ways. Full scale adoption of tokenisation and DLT markets are still a couple of years away. A lot of groundwork needs to happen in terms of building interoperability standards and consensus on regulation of digital assets. Smart contracts can automate processes in trade finance and supply chain management, reducing delays and increasing trust among parties involved. Indian Banks’ Digital Infrastructure Company, a consortium of 18 banks , is currently working on tokenisation and smart contract-based deep-tier financing for MSMEs as part of RBI’s regulatory sandbox. These initiatives will aid in blockchain adoption in the banking and financial services sector. As more industries recognise these efficiencies, I expect a broader adoption of blockchain solutions across sectors such as sustainable finance and blockchain based trading of carbon credits, especially under the aegis of GIFT - IFSCA. \\nComments\\n BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The token is leading the market after becoming the largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. On Thursday, Aptos Labs, the developer of the Aptos network, announced it had agreed to acquire the Japanese Blockchain developer HashPallete, the company behind Japan’s Palette Chain and a subsidiary of HashPort Inc. The agreement aims to become a “game changer for Japan and the Aptos ecosystem” as the integration with the Japanese blockchain is set to strengthen its presence in the Asian market: Japan has long been a hub of technological innovation, and it’s no different when it comes to blockchain. The country’s unique blend of advanced tech and widespread blockchain adoption makes it a model for Web3 initiatives globally. Today, we’re making one of our boldest strategic moves into this market with our agreement to acquire HashPalette Inc. As part of the acquisition, HashPort Inc. will migrate the Pallete Chain and its subsidiary’s applications to the Aptos Network. The Japanese chain will also have access to the Aptos ecosystem’s security, scalability, and developer tools. The migration is expected to be completed by early 2025, in time for the EXPO2025 DIGITAL WALLET. Moreover, Aptos Labs partnered with HashPort to support local developers, NFT creators, and enterprises by “continuing to build blockchain solutions (…) using Aptos Network’s infrastructure.” Following the announcement, APT’s price saw a daily 11% surge, jumping to the $8.66 resistance level before retracing to the $8.51 mark. This performance crowned the token as the leading crypto amid the market retrace. APT is among the few cryptocurrencies recording green numbers in most timeframes among the top 100 tokens by market cap. The altcoin registers a 7.5% and a 41% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Additionally, its daily market volume soared 41.7%, reaching a $769.6 million trading volume in the last 24 hours. The token’s performance was highlighted by several crypto analysts, who considered that APT has the “most interesting chart” at the moment. According to Yuriy from BikoTrading, the cryptocurrency looks strong as the rising trading volume and the price performance “signs for continued growth.” The trader noted that APT’s price held above the key resistance zone amid the market retrace, which sent the token above Q3’s range highs. Similarly, crypto trader Osbrah stated that APT has been “secretly climbing its way to the most interesting alts charts.” He pointed out that, after October 1’s market sweep, the token had a “clean bullish retest” above the $8 mark. To the trader, the next big resistance is at the $9 mark, which could send APT’s price to the $7.95 support zone if it fails to reclaim it. Meanwhile, another market watcher suggested that the altcoin’s performance could be close to a breakout. Per the post, SUI and APT moved in a “catch-up trade” path for the past year, moving closely together until SUI decoupled in early 2024. This led to a 44-day lagging period for APT before it followed SUI’s movements. After that, APT rose 98% to its yearly high of $18.8 in mid-March. Now, APT has seen a 32-day lagging period after SUI decoupled again in September, showing “incredible amounts of strength.” Based on this, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could follow SUI’s trajectory and kickstart a massive rally in the next two weeks if history repeats.

Using the medium of blockchain technology, it has kept some of its most valuable artworks in an Arctic vault, and less exposed to the elements. This is just one of the latest developments from a growing practice: slowly but surely, more and more institutions are coming to realize that protecting cultural heritage against environmental damage and degradation is long overdue. Therefore, Pekao Bank created digital representations of art with a focus on being able to withstand the environmental catastrophes of climate change for longer periods of time. Blockchain technology is set to revolutionize the mindset of owning and preserving art. In contrast to physical measures, an artifact would always be at the mercy of decay and damage, which has marred museums and collectors in the past. But with NFTs and digital forms of representation, the artworks can be tokenized and safely placed on blockchain networks. This does not only preserve the piece but also goes out to create a transparent and immutable record of ownership and provenance. Under modern 3D scanning technology, Bank Pekao is digitizing well-known Polish artworks including those by Jan Matejko and Stanisław Wyspiański for this project. Then kept on the environmentally friendly Aleph Zero blockchain as non-fungible tokens, these digital copies guarantee their long-term survival. The Arctic World Archive, a Svalbard, Norway, facility meant to save valuable data from hazards like cyberattacks and natural disasters, will also house the tokenized artwork. Archiv3 reports that the AWA is well-known for keeping scientific and cultural records from entities like UNESCO and the Vatican.  The digital nature of blockchain art forces a rethink of the old conservation practices. In the long term, institutions should tally up the future sustainability of the platforms and the possible longevity of access, as technology evolves. This is not about preserving just the physical artifacts themselves but also the ecosystem surrounding digital art. Although blockchain clearly helps to preserve art, there are challenges to be solved. Many artworks, for example, are delicate or fleeting, which makes damage or loss especially likely. Conventional approaches such as climate-controlled environments have limited capability. Artists can build safe digital representations that preserve their worth and enable more general access by tokenizing these pieces as NFTs. Legal and ethical issues also come into play. Museums acquiring NFTs begs issues concerning ownership rights and value. Institutions navigating this new terrain have to have clear regulations addressing this complexity to guarantee fair practices in collecting and presenting blockchain art. The integration of blockchain technology into art preservation moves beyond the tide; it represents a paradigm shift in how one appreciates and understands the value and longevity of art. Art museums such as The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) are spearheading efforts to collect digital art from different creators, but more particularly, by women artists. Such moves not only improve collection diversification but contribute to setting a precedent for best future practices in the conservation of digital art. With this technology, more institutions are joining the bandwagon. Discussions over what art really is will continue developing. By embracing the best of the traditional expression of art and the latest technology, we are seeing the lines of appreciation and engagement with cultural heritage blur. Initiatives like Arctic vault by Pekao Bank ensure that our artistic legacy remains safe in such an ever-changing world.

The asset manager said Wednesday that the move was a \"massive step in the right direction\" to \"innovate in the name of a truly decentralized and accessible financial future.\" Aptos is the blockchain behind APT, the 30th-biggest digital coin by market cap. Its network was founded by part of the team behind Meta\\'s failed Diem project. Developers can use the blockchain to build decentralized apps (dapps), launch tokens, and more. \"We chose the Aptos network given its unique characteristics, which meet our rigorous suitability standards for the Benji platform,” Franklin Templeton\\'s head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, said. FOBXX is a digitized fund that lets customers put cash into U.S. government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements. Investors can buy shares of FOBXX and hold them in digital wallets via Franklin Templeton\\'s Benji Investments mobile app. Franklin Templeton has put the fund on a number of blockchains, including Avalanche, Arbitrum, Stellar, and Polygon. Avalanche was the most recent addition before Aptos, coming in late August. The firm said that FOBXX is the first and only U.S.-registered fund to use a public blockchain as the system of record to process transactions and record share ownership. Franklin Templeton has been dipping its toes in the crypto world since 2019, when it started digitizing shares for a money market fund on the Stellar blockchain. It also announced a digital asset venture fund two years ago.

The Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP), the company announced Thursday (Oct. 3), is available on Visa’s development platform to allow its banking partners “to create and experiment with their own fiat-backed tokens in a VTAP sandbox.” The effort, Visa said in a news release provided to PYMNTS, will employ the company’s expertise in technologies like smart contracts to let banks issue and transfer fiat-backed tokens over blockchain networks. “Visa has been at the forefront of digital payments for nearly sixty years, and with the introduction of VTAP, we are once again setting the pace for the industry,” Vanessa Colella, Visa’s global head of innovation and digital partnerships, said in the release.\\xa0 “We’re excited to leverage our experience with tokenization to help banks integrate blockchain technologies into their operations.” According to the release, Spanish bank BBVA has already been testing VTAP sandbox functionalities this year, including the issuance, transfer and redemption of a bank token on a testnet blockchain, along with interactions of the token with smart contracts. The bank aims to launch an initial live pilot with select customers on the public Ethereum blockchain next year, Visa added. The benefits of VTAP include its ease of integration, programmability and interoperability, the release notes. “There is a growing ecosystem where tokenized real-world assets are being issued across multiple permissioned and public blockchain networks,” the company said. “Visa’s vision is to enable interoperability across different blockchains for banks utilizing the VTAP platform.” With an API connection to VTAP, in the future, banks can allow multiple use cases and interact with partners and clients on permissioned and public blockchains.\\xa0 “To support the broad ecosystem adoption of tokenized assets, Visa is committed to enabling safe and secure cross-chain exchanges of tokenized real world assets using fiat-backed tokens,” the release added. PYMNTS examined the role blockchain technology plays in cross-border payments in a recent conversation with Sheraz Shere, general manager of payments and commerce at Solana Foundation. “Blockchain solutions and stablecoins, I don’t like to use the term crypto because this is more about FinTech, they’ve found product-market-fit in cross-border payments,” Shere said. He added that one of the most notable benefits of blockchain technology is disintermediation — doing away with the need for the multiple hops through correspondent banks, which typically make transactions slower and more costly. \\xa0 We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors. ...', 'label': 'Block Chain', 'author': 'PYMNTS'}, {'id': 41, 'urls': 'https://biztoc.com/x/b63d23e30d232240', 'title': 'UK’s City minister pushes for blockchain gilts despite concerns', 'brief': 'Treasury unit has raised questions over new technology', 'image': 'https://biztoc.com/cdn/802/og.png', 'content': '\\n        Treasury unit has raised questions over new technology\\n     ...', 'label': 'Block Chain', 'author': 'ft.com'}, {'id': 42, 'urls': 'https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/04/2958351/0/en/DMG-Blockchain-Solutions-Announces-Preliminary-September-2024-Operational-Results.html', 'title': 'DMG Blockchain Solutions Announces Preliminary September 2024 Operational Results', 'brief': 'VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fraud prevention platform Trustpair announced the integration of investment bank JPMorgan’s blockchain-based solution Confirm to verify bank account information on Oct. 1. Confirm is a closed network for global account validation information built on Liink, the enterprise-focused permissioned and private blockchain developed by JPMorgan’s Onyx division. Gloria Wan, Executive Director at Onyx by J.P. Morgan, stated that Confirm was created to provide collective intelligence to improve decision-making for companies. She added: “Businesses operate in a data-driven world, yet many still rely on inaccurate vendor and payment data when making high-value transactions, which significantly raises companies’ risk of fraud, payment errors, and delays.” As a result, Trustpair’s over 200 customers — including companies such as Societe Generale, Decathlon, and Danone — can now verify vendor bank accounts across 15 global markets, reducing the risk of payment fraud and payment delays. Trustpair’s co-founder and CEO, Baptiste Collot, added that applying JPMorgan’s blockchain solution will set a higher standard for fraud prevention and user experience. JPMorgan’s stance towards the blockchain industry has changed considerably since 2017, when the lender’s CEO, Jamie Dimon,\\xa0called Bitcoin a fraud. In 2019, the investment bank launched its own crypto — the JPM Coin — for wholesale payments between institutions. One year later, JPMorgan launched its blockchain-focused Onyx unit. JPMorgan executed its first transaction on a public blockchain in November 2022. The bank issued and swapped 100,000 Singaporean dollars for Japan’s yen with SBI Digital Asset Holdings on the Polygon blockchain using a forked version of the leading money market Aave. According to Onyx’s website, JPMorgan now provides three different major products leveraging blockchain besides Liink. Coin Systems is a bank-focused solution for transfer and clearing that leverages JPM Coin. Blockchain Launch is a team within the Onyx unit that provides blockchain service to JPMorgan’s clients, while Onyx Digital Assets is the investment bank’s tokenization platform.

Google is rolling out iOS support for its Gmail Q&A feature, which gives users a Gemini-powered AI assistant to help manage their inbox. The Gemini side panel for Gmail was introduced to web and Android devices earlier this year and can potentially provide an easier way to locate specific information that’s buried within emails and Google Drive. Users can ask the Gmail chatbot questions about the contents of their inbox or connected Google Drive, such as finding lost contact information or company data. The Gmail Q&A feature can summarize emails around a particular topic, surface unread messages or emails from a specific sender, and answer general questions from Google search directly within the inbox. Like the web and Android versions, the Gmail Q&A feature on iOS is only available to Google One AI Premium subscribers or Google Workspace accounts with Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, or Education Premium add-ons. Google says it’s rolling out to those groups now, but it may take a couple of weeks to appear.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.
