            "content": "In years to come, Silicon Valley may view the events of the past few weeks as the moment the generative AI boom got too frothy.  Investors spent the summer wondering if top AI stocks could continue to justify soaring valuations in the face of absent returns from their massive AI spending. Now, signs have emerged that they're not yet done with generative AI mania. As September rolled into October, some of the most significant investment areas in AI received fresh votes of confidence \u2014 be it in the chip space, the large language model arena, and devices.  But there could be reason to feel cautious about the latest developments. Cerebras, a chip startup, included an eyebrow-raising detail in its IPO prospectus. But first, here's a quick primer on the Sunnyvale-based company.  Founded in 2015, Cerebras aims to accelerate AI development by designing processors to train and deploy smarter LLMs. It believes these processors, among other offerings, can compete with the powerful chips sold by Nvidia. That's no walk in the park. Nvidia has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, having grown from a market capitalization of $364 billion at the start of 2023 to over $3 trillion. As things stand, however, Cerebras' plan to take it on involves generating the vast majority of its revenue from just one customer: Abu Dhabi-based AI firm G42. According to its IPO prospectus, Cerebras \u2014 backed by investment firms such as Altimeter, Benchmark, and Coatue \u2014 generated 83% of its $78.6 million revenue in 2023 and 87% of the $136.4 million revenue generated in the first half of 2024 from G42. Founded in 2018, G42 has emerged as one of the Middle East's biggest AI opportunities. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, owns a stake, as do Microsoft and the private equity firm Silver Lake. There appears to be reason to work with G42, then, but by Cerebras' admission, an \"adverse\" change in the relationship could harm the chip firm. While Cerebras has sought to strengthen its customer base \u2014 it reached an agreement with oil giant Saudi Aramco in September \u2014 its revenue concentration will weigh on investors as it aims to raise $1 billion in its public listing at a $7 billion to $8 billion valuation, per Bloomberg. Warning signals emerged elsewhere as OpenAI shook up the market for LLMs on Wednesday by closing the most valuable funding round in Silicon Valley history. While the ChatGPT maker announced that it had raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation from a series of new and existing investors, it did so with a few notable asterisks. For one, per the Financial Times, OpenAI has asked its investors not to back its rivals, which include Anthropic, Elon Musk's xAI, and Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the startup founded in June by OpenAI's former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever. While it has the right to do this, the ask is unusual in the world of startup investing, where venture capitalists often spread their bets. Gary Marcus, a professor who testified next to OpenAI's Sam Altman at a Congress hearing in 2023, described the move as OpenAI \"running scared.\" David Sacks, general partner at Craft Ventures, called the ask a \"shady\" one. \"The mask is really coming off,\" he wrote on X. It is also worth taking a closer look at some of the investors in its latest round. As my colleague Darius Rafieyan noted earlier this week, some of the most \"prolific bubble chasers\" \u2014 investors with a track record of betting on companies close to their peak \u2014 now count themselves as OpenAI backers. Think SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that burned billions of dollars on WeWork, and Tiger Global, an investment fund that suffered brutal losses in recent years after going on huge startup betting sprees. This has taken place against a backdrop of wider challenges. OpenAI no longer has a chief technology officer after Mira Murati quit the firm late last month, becoming the latest top-tier executive to depart. The company has also been battling to reverse its lossmaking operations. According to a September report from The New York Times, OpenAI's monthly revenue grew to $300 million in August \u2014but it has projected $5 billion in losses this year. The other notable sign of market frothiness came as Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a bold new wearable device for the AI era: Meta's Orion. The augmented reality glasses, introduced at the company's Connect conference in late September, put AI front and center by embedding the technology in a way that \"can sense and understand the world around you,\" according to Meta. While they have impressed \u2014 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gave a glowing endorsement of the wearables in a promotional video, and Meta's stock responded positively after the event \u2014 there are a few matters to consider beyond the hype for it. The first is cost. According to The Verge's Alex Heath, who spoke to Meta executives, the cost of building a single Orion unit at present is a steep $10,000. Even if that cost can be brought down \u2014 something Orion lead Rahul Prasad told The Verge would be a focus of the device's next development phase \u2014 Meta will need to contend with the fact that appetite for these wearables hasn't exactly impressed in the past. Meta rival Snapchat took a go at introducing glasses to the market in the mid-2010s but failed to make a splash after incurring a $40 million loss on them. It is taking another crack with AI-embedded eyewear, announcing a partnership last month with OpenAI to embed its tech. Other form factors for AI that have emerged recently, such as the Humane AI pin that launched in April and the pocketable rabbit R1 introduced in January, have largely flopped, too. Where does this leave us? In short, a lossmaking startup must justify its $157 billion valuation. A chip firm worth up to $8 billion must persuade investors not to worry about its undiversified revenue streams. Meta will need to convince consumers to switch to another way of interacting with AI entirely.  All of these things may come to pass. If so, this will be seen as a juncture where AI goes on to truly revolutionize the industries it touches \u2014 and repay the faith of investors. But if history is anything to go by, the high-stakes tech world is rarely plain sailing.      Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES ...",

            "brief": "Almost a year after a fake clip of a high school principal went viral, the impact on an American town lingers.",

            "content": "Community volunteer Alfie Malone and reporter Kristen Griffith both struggled with what to make of an offensive audio clip that turned out to be fake When an audio clip appeared to show a local school principal making derogatory comments, it went viral online, sparked death threats against the educator and sent ripples through a suburb outside the city of Baltimore. But it was soon exposed as a fake, manipulated by artificial intelligence - so why do people still believe it\u2019s real? \u201cI seriously don't understand why I have to constantly put up with these dumbasses here every day.\u201d So began what appeared to be a long tirade from the principal of Pikesville High School, punctuated with racist, antisemitic and offensive tropes. It sounded like it had been secretly recorded. The speaker went on to bemoan \u201cungrateful black kids\u201d and Jewish people in the community. The clip, first posted in January, went viral nationally. But it really struck a nerve in the peaceful, leafy suburb of Pikesville, which has large black and Jewish populations, and in the nearby city of Baltimore, Maryland. Principal Eric Eiswert was put on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Alfie Malone, a black man who lives in nearby Baltimore, spotted other members of his community posting the clip and assumed it was real. \u201cIn the back of your mind you think this is probably the way people really actually feel about us,\u201d Mr Malone said. \u201cAnd then to hear that actually come across audio.\u201d In an effort to corroborate what he was hearing, Mr Malone checked out other real recordings of Mr Eiswert on social media and they sounded the same. So the part-time postman, part-time podcaster hit the re-share button. US teacher accused of racist deepfake of principal They were arrested for posting during the riots \u2013 will it change anything? The clip started to gain traction across social media as more people spread it online. One of the most shared versions was well on its way to passing two million views within hours. Already, that\u2019s around 60 times the entire population of Pikesville. But what those sharing the clip didn\u2019t realise at the time was that another bombshell was about to drop: the clip was an AI-generated fake. For BBC Radio 4\u2019s Why Do You Hate Me USA, I\u2019ve been in Maryland investigating the impact this clip had on that town. It reads almost like a fable about the dangers AI poses, especially when local communities are targeted. When the clip landed on the desk of Kristen Griffith, an education reporter at the Baltimore Banner, she thought it was going be a relatively straightforward story of a teacher being exposed for making offensive remarks. But as is best-practice in journalism, Ms Griffith wanted to give the principal the chance to comment and tell his side of the story. So, she reached out to his union representative, who said not only did Mr Eiswert condemn the comments, but he didn\u2019t make them. \u201cHe said right away, oh, we think this is fake\u2026 We believe it's AI,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cI hadn't heard that angle\u201d before. But when she published that explanation, her readers were not convinced. Far from raising questions about the clip\u2019s veracity, it just fuelled backlash from people who thought the allegation of fakery was just an excuse or an attempt to evade accountability. It was at this point that local police started investigating the case. Staff at Pikesville High told them they were feeling unsafe because of all the attention, and they were concerned that the school was bugged with recording devices. Principal Eiswert\u2019s reputation had taken a serious hit too. Security was stepped up around both him and the school.  He became a target for social media hate and threats. I found dozens of abusive messages taking aim at him on social media. When police and the school board superintendent announced a Pikesville High faculty member had faked the audio, it sent shockwaves through the community Then in April, Baltimore Police Chief Robert McCullough confirmed they now had \u201cconclusive evidence that the recording was not authentic\u201d. And they believed they knew who made the fake. Police charged 31-year-old Dazhon Darien, the school\u2019s athletics director, with several counts related to the fake video. Charges included theft, retaliating against a witness and stalking. He was arrested at the airport, where police say he was planning to fly to Houston, Texas. Police say that Mr Darien had been under investigation by Principal Eiswert over an alleged theft of $1,916 (\u00a31,460) from the school. They also allege there had been \u201cwork performance challenges\u201d and his contract was likely not to be renewed. Their theory was that by creating the deepfake recording, he hoped to discredit the principal before he could be fired. Investigators say they traced an email used to send the original video to a server connected to Mr Darien, and allege that he used Baltimore County Public Schools' computer network to access AI tools. He is due to stand trial in December 2024. Mr Darien\u2019s legal representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Myriam Rogers had previously said it was \u201ca very difficult time\u201d for the school community, the principal and his family. Representatives for Pikesville High School and Mr Eiswert did not respond to my requests for further comment. Because the clip was audio-only, it meant there were no visual giveaways, like robotic movements that normally reveal AI manipulation. It also mentioned jargon, like \u201cgrade-level expectations\u201d, and other details, like staff names, that only people close to the school would know. When you listen carefully, though, there are clear edits between sentences - and the voice, while similar to the principal, sounds quite monotonous. Artificial intelligence can use several minutes of a real recording - from, say, your favourite actor in a film or a presidential candidate giving a speech - to then generate a clip that makes it sound like they said something they never did. But perhaps the biggest reason why people believed the video was real was because it felt true, Mr Malone told me. It tapped into his own experiences of racism as a black man living in Baltimore. When Mr Malone heard the principal describe black students as lazy, it immediately reminded him of slurs and discrimination he\u2019d encountered at school and work. Months later, the effects of the fake audio clip are still felt in Pikesville. Mr Eiswert has moved jobs and is working in another school. And even though some community members told me they now accept the video is fake, the damage is done. \u201cThis is a Jewish neighbourhood and to say something that's so inflammatory about the community was upsetting,\u201d a woman called Sharon told me as she packed her grandchild\u2019s pram into a car in a house opposite the high school last August. For several minutes, Sharon talked to me as though the clip was real. \u201cI think when people say things like that, other people join in that and it makes me more fearful.\u201d When her husband chimed in from the car, reminding her the clip was actually fake, she admitted she did \u201cfind out later it was AI-generated\u201d. But she said she was still angry about it. The clip continues to affect the local community in Pikesville and those connected to the high school I found that for people like Sharon, who had believed the clip was real, even for a short time, it stayed with them - especially when the message echoed genuine experiences of racism and discrimination. It reminded me of something I hear time and time again while investigating misinformation and conspiracy theories: \u201cWell, even if it\u2019s not real, it\u2019s what I think they think.\u201d All the major social media companies say they have policies to label, remove and limit the spread of AI-generated posts. But that action only happens when it can be proven a clip is fake. By that point, it could have already reached millions of people. Alfie Malone said even earlier that day, he spoke to a friend who still had no idea the clip was AI-generated. \u201cI honestly believe that a lot of people here in this city don't really know that that's not true,\u201d he said. He said he felt sorry that Mr Eiswert, the school principal, was wrongly accused of making the comments. He is also worried the episode has undermined real experiences of racism. He said he\u2019d think twice before re-sharing a clip like this again. \u201cI've been burnt by the fire once. I'm not touching the stove again.\u201d 'Worst night so far in Beirut' as Israel issues fresh evacuation orders in southern Lebanon Israeli strikes on Gaza mosque and school kill 26, health ministry says Ex-cabinet secretary says \u00a3200,000 job is underpaid 'Rightmove is my porn' - the addiction to online property search We married for \u00a3100 with 99 other couples and wouldn't change a thing Trump and Harris are deadlocked -  could an October surprise change the game?

            "content": "Your changes have been saved  Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You\u2019ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. Google announced its newest entry into the Workspace suite of AI-powered apps, Google Vids, in June 2024. Google Vids isn't the text-to-video tool you might expect. After watching its introductory video, it's clear how Google views this new tool being used. The announcement came on behalf of the Google Slides Team. Google Vids looks more like AI-assisted Google Slides than it does a video editor. This might be exciting for some people who use Workspace for business or video production, but not so much for the average consumer. When we think of AI video, we typically think of generative AI, but could this be a handy tool for some? Google's demo video advertises Google Vids as a corporate presentation editor for things like product pitch videos or employee training videos. What you edit is more of a souped-up PowerPoint presentation that can be downloaded as a video or shared with a link. The primary interface looks a lot like Google Slides. The editor features a basic video timeline and tools similar to Slides for adding text, images, and videos. As Google Vids rolls out to Workspace users, there's a 10-minute time limit, and it only supports horizontal video content. The interface is intuitive, especially for those familiar with Google Slides. The scene-based editor allows you to edit visual and audio content in each scene, keeping you organized and able to easily re-order your scenes. The UI is heavily influenced by Slides and was developed with business users in mind. Managing your Google Workspace is pretty simple Even though Google says Google Vids helps you create a video using AI, it doesn't help you create the actual video content. You can't create a video of people working in an office or using your product. The AI-powered aspects of Google Vids focus on the early stages of video production. You can use Help me create to make an editable storyboard outline, suggested scenes with suggested text, and a generated script for recording your voiceovers. All you do is enter a prompt, and Gemini does the rest. Gemini primarily powers the AI functionality, but other processes may occur behind the scenes. You can add related files before generating your outline to improve the output quality and give the AI a better idea of the project you're working on. You can use Gemini's text-to-image generator, Imagen 3, inside Google Vids. The integration is seamless if you need to create an image of an asset you don't have. As people get more used to prompting, struggling to get the output you imagine is commonplace. If you have difficulty with your prompts, you can generate new suggested ones to get you started. If you want to give Gemini a try, these tips and tricks will help you out After creating your video outline, you can collaborate on it in real time, like you can in Docs, Sheets, and Slides. You can add your own text, images, and music. You can also use royalty-free stock content from Google's library. You can customize the look and feel of your video by choosing a design template, or you can create your own.  Your video storyboard outline contains several media placeholders, suggested places to add live voiceovers, and places to swap out the temporary stock video with your own. There's also a built-in function to record video of yourself, your voice, and your computer screen using its recording studio. You can download your video as an MP4 or share it with a link when you finish. Google Vids targets corporate users, making it look like it's competing with Loom and similar competitors. It's unlikely to appeal to many regular content creators, who can use basic tools like YouTube Studio to edit their videos, or more professional editing apps like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve. The recording studio features can be done with any desktop operating system (even ChromeOS used on budget Chromebooks), so the unique selling points are the Google Slides-like editing and group collaboration. Google Workspace Labs, like its regular counterpart, Google Labs, is how Google releases experimental products and features before fully adopting them. It's been a testing ground for various features that have been integrated into its suites, but we've also seen several Google products discontinued over the years. Remember Google Reader, Google+, Google Hangouts, or Inbox by Gmail? We don't know if Google Vids will make it into the public sphere, but right now, only businesses with a Workspace subscription who have activated Workspace Labs can create a video with Google Vids. If you use Google Workspace, you can sign up for Workspace Labs to see if Google Vids is something you're interested in. If you don't have Google Workspace, you can get a 14-day trial, and after that, you'll need to sign up for a one-year commitment with Google's standard Workspace pricing to keep using it. Could this replace slide-style business presentations? Probably not. Slides has been around forever because the format makes sense. Presenters don't want to pause a video at the right moment and then have to scrub back if they missed their timing. Modern slide tools allow videos to be embedded, so there's no reason to switch. Google may have been better off reserving the Google Vids name for a product better suited to it. If you don't have access to Google Vids, learn a few Gemini tricks to transform Google Slides presentations and get the job done in style.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI introduced canvas, a new feature for ChatGPT that allows users to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with the chatbot on writing and coding projects. Canvas, which was made available in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Team users this week, was built with the startup\u2019s GPT-4o model. OpenAI plans to make canvas available to free ChatGPT users when it\u2019s out of beta mode. The feature opens in a separate window, and \u201ccan give inline feedback and suggestions\u201d on projects the way a copy editor or code reviewer would, OpenAI said. Microsoft (MSFT) announced new AI features for Windows 11 and its Copilot+ PCs, which are built to handle AI-powered tasks. The \u201cnext wave\u201d of AI features include Recall, a tool that saves screenshots to remind users of what they previously saw on their PC, and Click to Do, which suggests \u201cquick actions\u201d over images and text.  The company also released an update for Windows 11 that swaps the operating system to one with a foundation to run AI applications and services.  German AI startup DeepL launched its first U.S.-based tech hub in New York City this week. The startup, which develops leading-edge AI translation and writing tools, will \u201cfocus on accelerating research and product development,\u201d and improve market leadership in the U.S. through its new hub, it said. The company also added two new members to its C-suite: chief technology officer Sebastian Enderlein, and chief marketing officer Steve Rotter. \u201cLaunching DeepL\u2019s first US tech hub in New York City positions us at the center of one of the largest talent pools in the market and brings us closer to our customers, including many Fortune 500 companies,\u201d Jarek Kutylowski, founder and chief executive of DeepL, said in a statement. \u201cThis hub will drive our focus on product innovation and engineering, empowering us to deliver cutting-edge language AI solutions that help our clients scale and break down language barriers.\u201d Augmented Intelligence, an AI startup focused on AI agents, announced a partnership with Google Cloud (GOOGL) \u201caimed at accelerating the deployment of AI agents for consumer and enterprise companies.\u201d Apollo, the startup\u2019s \u201cagentic\u201d language model, \u201cis built with a neuro-symbolic architecture to enable a new generation of conversational agents,\u201d AUI said. The model combines generative AI\u2019s \u201cconversational skills\u201d with the predictability and actionability capabilities of rule-based AI.  \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have the support of Google Cloud, and our newly announced strategic partnership will help us reach and co-sell to a vast pool of customers who have come to expect the highest standards of security and compliance from Google Cloud,\u201d Ohad Elhelo, chief executive of Augmented Intelligence, said in a statement shared with Quartz. \u201cAUI provides Google Cloud customers with a powerful solution tailored to any conversational use-case or industry.\u201d AITran, a translation platform powered by AI, made its debut at the China-ASEAN Expo this week. The platform, which has \u201cmilitary-grade encryption and cutting-edge AI\u201d makes \u201cnear-instantaneous\u201d translations, has multi-user capabilities, and uses \u201cadvanced noise-cancelling technology\u201d so users can translate in loud environments.  The platform is available in the Asian market, but AITran is planning to expand to Europe and North America, and has an app available to download from Google Play and the App Store. Liquid AI, a spin-off of MIT, launched its Liquid Foundational Models (LFMs) that it says \u201cbring unprecedented levels of performance and efficiency to generative AI.\u201d Compared to other GPT models, Liquid\u2019s LFMs are more cost-effective and power efficient, the startup said.  \u201cWe build AI systems from a new set of algorithms for data curation, pre-, mid- and post- training, model architecture design, and evaluation metrics\u201d Ramin Hasani, Liquid AI chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cOur new methods in designing foundation models unlock a new scaling law for LLMs. we\u2019ve improved quality, cost-effectiveness, and power efficiency compared to today\u2019s models at every scale.\u201d Mostly AI, a pioneer of structured synthetic data, launched its synthetic text functionality, which gives Fortune 500 companies, including Databricks and Amazon Web Services (AMZN), access to a \u201cvast amount of proprietary text\u201d to train and fine-tune large language models, or LLMs \u2014 without compromising user privacy, it said. On the Mostly AI platform, users can upload original text data, such as emails and transcripts of customer support calls, and choose an open-source language model from Hugging Face to generate the synthetic data. The original data is used to fine-tune the LLM on the Mostly AI platform, which then generates synthetic text that can be downloaded or stored in a database. \u201cToday, AI training is hitting a plateau as models exhaust public data sources and yield diminishing returns,\u201d Tobias Hann, chief executive of Mostly AI, said in a statement. \u201cTo harness high-quality, proprietary data, which offers far greater value and potential than the residual public data currently being used, global enterprises must take the leap and leverage both structured and unstructured synthetic data to safely train and deploy forthcoming generative AI solutions.\u201d  ...",

            "content": "Login \nRo \n05 October 2024\n \nSamsung\n During this year's Samsung Developer Conference, the company announced its upcoming One UI 7 based on Android 15. Arguably, this is the most interesting bit of the whole keynote. Still, there are other developments with Samsung products, like Tizen OS, for example. As a quick reminder, One UI 7 will arrive in early 2025, while a beta version of the software will be seeded to users by the end of this year. The new OS will feature a UI redesign, more customization options and deeper AI integration that will be more contextual\u2014depending on location, surroundings, etc. Speaking of AI, Samsung also announced on-device AI capabilities for Tizen OS-powered devices. This will enable a more responsive and personalized experience and better integration with the Galaxy ecosystem. Thanks to AI, users will be able to control devices seamlessly and complete tasks on the go. Even refrigerators and vacuum cleaners will get a taste of AI. For instance, AI Vision will be implemented into refrigerators, so you will have up-to-date information about what you have inside the fridge and get relevant recipe suggestions. And AI Floor Detect will make vacuums more efficient and intelligent. Samsung's SmartThings ecosystem will become smarter with AI too. It will offer Home Insight, which analyzes real-time data and patterns to optimize home management. Samsung's AI tech has also been integrated into Bixby, providing advanced voice control features without wake-up commands. Smart displays, including TVs, feature AI for content recommendations, AI upscaling, and even real-time customization using generative AI. Source Only a number some fools watch Apple boring even for introducing a capture button. And rest of the views came from ads. Samsung fooled people by dropping skype support on their tizen smart tv. Nah, AI content recommendations and AI upscaling are not something you can't live without.  \n\n\nPhone finder\n \n\n\nAll brands\n\n\n\nRumor mill\n\n \nHome\nNews\nReviews\nCompare\nCoverage\nGlossary\nFAQ\nRSS feed\nYoutube\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\n \r\n\u00a9 2000-2024 GSMArena.com\nMobile version\nAndroid app\nTools\nContact us\nMerch store\nPrivacy\nTerms of use\nChange Ad Consent\nDo not sell my data\n ...",

It\u2019s like the birth of sound. It\u2019s that transformative moment where films will never be the same, and we can\u2019t imagine where they\u2019re going to go, and it\u2019s going to give birth to a whole new generation of creatives and artists who are going to learn how to make films in this manner. The whole concept of narrative is going to change. The whole concept of length of content and concept of celebrity is going to change. It\u2019ll take time, perhaps a generation, but we\u2019re at the very birth of this moment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\tHe added: \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful, because I see that there\u2019s going to be a new cinematic language, new manners of creativity. For me, this is all very exciting, and I\u2019m very curious to see how it unfolds.\u201d \n\tFlawless is one of the leaders in the field of AI in indie cinema using tools such as TrueSync to dub performances into different languages and modify scenes. Theatrical and streaming hit The Fall (pictured above) is among their movies designed to streamline the production process and reduce costs. Principal Rivera noted that there are still hurdles to overcome in terms of quality control. \n\tHe said: \u201cAI is amazing, and it really raises the bar for what people can do, but for cinematic films, there\u2019s the quality. The resolution, the color depth, color space. Research science is not built on this\u2026.Also, if you modify some someone\u2019s performance, you really need to get their consent based on how substantial that changes is.\u201d \n\tRivera noted that the company had worked very closely with the Hollywood guilds around the time of the strikes to ensure that ethical standards are being upheld.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tHe said: \u201cFrom the very inception of the company, we\u2019ve been talking to the guilds about this. We were really imploring them to lean into this and to think about it. As we were having these conversations, what became clear is that as the technology evolves, new rights around consent start to emerge that need to be managed\u2026The right to allow a company to use your image and likeness in a generated performance, for example.\u201d \n\tProducer Murphy acknowledged that hundreds of thousands of dollars can be saved in reshoots on indie movies using AI production tools. \n\tWME Partner Jacquemin noted: \u201cIt reminds me of that early couple of years after the iPhone launched and the App Store launched, where most of the product that you saw felt like a toy. It wasn\u2019t quite real\u2026A lot of our clients are now in the development phase using these AI tools to storyboard things as easier ways to pitch their their ideas. But you\u2019re also starting to see products that could absolutely be used in a filmmaking sense.\u201d \n\tBut he acknowledged that studios and companies need to be kept in check when it comes to consent and permissions. \n\t\u201cA few years ago we had two different major media companies that were negotiating deals with our clients. Their perspective was, \u2018we own that voice for this animated project so can use it for sequels and derivatives without having to go back to the actor\u2019. One was a film, one was a TV show. I remember thinking \u2018This is crazy. This can\u2019t this can\u2019t work. This is not how the business is going to sustain\u2019.  \n\tFinally, the panel was asked whether there will be an AI movie star, \u201can AI Harrison Ford\u201d. The panel agreed there would be in the near future. \n\tJacquemin commented: \u201cYeah, I think so. A number of years ago, we were representing a company that was creating virtual worlds, and they believed then that some of those digital characters, no different than video game characters, could develop some sort of celebrity status. It just seems inevitable that there\u2019ll be some version of that.\u201d Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n Sam Drury is UX director at UIC Digital, a creative engineering company with a focus on building digital products with a well-built and accessible appeal. Beginning his career as a Paper Engineer at Santoro Graphics, Sam \"caught the bug\" when designing his first UX wireframe, leading him to pursue a successful career in UX design. Working with clients like the BBC, FIFA and NBC, Sam has led multiple teams with a drive for quality and innovation. As part of our Day in the Life series, I caught up with Sam to discuss the pioneering work of UIC Labs, his favourite creative tools and what the rise of AI means for the UX industry.  I always start the day by walking my daughter to school \u2013 I find it\u2019s a great opportunity to get a seven year old\u2019s perspective on the world! I\u2019ve been at UIC Digital for so long now (14 years) because no two days are the same. Typically I\u2019ll be checking in with the team on active projects and providing any guidance and oversight needed. We\u2019ll also generally be in the process of pitching for new projects so a lot of time goes into concepting ideas and our approach to working on them.  I\u2019ve always worked in the creative field \u2013 my first job fresh from uni was as a paper engineer; I basically spent all day with a scalpel in hand making pop-up books and 3D greeting cards. The owner of that company wanted some bespoke software made so I volunteered to sketch out how it might work and what it might look like. Unbeknownst to me, I created my first UX wireframe for an application and I guess I caught the bug.  A very common challenge is working with client-side senior stakeholders and managing their expectations around the users of the product we\u2019re working on. There\u2019s often a misconception that all users will have their level of technical knowhow, as well as a familiarity with the problem we\u2019re trying to solve. This is almost never the case, so we use lots of techniques, including persona creation, empathy mapping or user interviews to help them see a true reflection of those we\u2019re designing for.  Definitely the full redesign and rebuild of BBC.com (for users outside of the UK). There were so many challenges we faced with a project of this scale and complexity. I\u2019m so proud of how our design team at UIC embedded themselves in with the BBC and the level of collaboration we saw was phenomenal. Even though we\u2019re still a long way from completion, the product that is live today is receiving great feedback and there\u2019s lots of cool stuff still to come.  Much of our creative work is now done in Figma \u2013 I was lucky enough to be invited to talk at Figma\u2019s Config in San Francisco in June and it\u2019s exciting to see where they\u2019re taking the product.We also use Miro a lot; particularly at the early stages of a project or when we\u2019re gathering ideas for a pitch. I find it\u2019s very accessible for those less tech-savvy and gives everyone I\u2019m working with a great place to share their thoughts. That being said I have about eight plain sketchbooks on my desk which is always the go-to place to get initial ideas down before going anywhere near a screen.  Any project that just becomes the default for someone to pick up and use, without giving it a second thought, in any particular scenario. Google Maps for planning a journey, Uber for hailing a ride for example. You could say I\u2019ve already done that with the work with the BBC; we know it\u2019s the first place many people go to check the news.  We can see it clearly having an impact already. The creative aspect of AI is certainly not there yet and we\u2019re still a way off having AI meaningfully design interfaces beyond some interesting suggestions and interpretations. Where I am seeing a big impact though is helping with some of the more monotonous tasks; interpreting lots of research data, helping define personas, and even writing job specs. It\u2019s everyday, typically text-based or numerical tasks it\u2019s really good for but I\u2019m excited to see where it\u2019s going to go in the not-too-distant future.  Asking for and justifying a bit more time around initial research and testing on projects. I\u2019ve spoken to so many UX professionals who say the same thing; the client (for one reason or another) wants to get into the hands-on design phase as quickly as possible. Selling the idea of even a small amount of up-front research at the outset of a project is often met with stiff resistance, but when it does happen, the value it imparts to the subsequent design output is immeasurable. I\u2019d argue the same is true for early user testing of design concepts.  We formed UIC Labs a couple of years ago with the intention of creating a space for the team at UIC Digital to come up with ideas or a desire to build on brand new technology outside of the day to day client project work we are involved in. We\u2019ll often build out proof of concepts and where appropriate we might demo this to an existing client to gauge interest. Currently, as is to be expected, it\u2019s all about AI and we\u2019ve got some really exciting things in the pipeline both as internal projects and a few that will make a big impact on how our clients work too.  Quite how much time, care and attention went into those everyday interactions that work so well, you don\u2019t even seem to notice them. People are very vocal about bad experiences, and that\u2019s completely justified, especially for a service you might be paying for. But those great, frictionless user experiences, whether it\u2019s instantly being able to watch hundreds of videos on your phone, booking an appointment, or ordering a meal from your sofa, don\u2019t tend to get the recognition they deserve. So much thought went into these to make them \u2018just work\u2019!  Loads! Don\u2019t assume that the loudest or most senior person in the room knows what they\u2019re talking about and be prepared to fight your corner. Always be on the lookout for design inspiration outside of your industry; especially in nature and the world around you. I\u2019ll often find the best solution to a design challenge is by not focussing too closely on what others in your immediate field are doing. Read more broadly. Empathy for users is absolutely crucial for success in our industry and books are an amazing way to get an insight into so many different viewpoints.

Google Notebook LLM in the classroom, totally and completely fucked up. But the industry's cheerleaders keep cheering. I\u2019ve spent the last few years trying my best to ignore all this stuff. After Isaiah\u2019s death, I simply could not handle more grief. I\u2019m not sure how else to describe the emotions that I feel about education -- this deep, deep sadness about about what feels like the surrender of any shared cultural belief in, any political commitment to, any financial investment in public education; a real despair about our handing teaching and learning over to the neoliberal elites, to the values of productivity, efficiency, individualism. I\u2019d lost my son -- the future already felt dimmer for it. I didn\u2019t have the energy to fight. I stepped away. Since I\u2019ve been gone, not much has changed -- other than I\u2019ve been proven right about just about every startup and gadget I warned folks about. Not that that\u2019s stopped anyone from hyping the latest snake oil -- it\u2019s AI this time around (again) I guess. In the quest for data and \u201coptimization,\u201d we continue to drain the humanity from institutions that, frankly, were never that humane in the first place (despite all the teachers and students who populate these institutions and who do, I firmly believe, care deeply about one another). I\u2019ve flailed around since leaving Hack Education dormant, thinking I\u2019d just do something else instead of being \u201ced-tech\u2019s Cassandra.\u201d I\u2019ve become an athlete for the first time in my life, and I thought perhaps I could write a similar sort of tech criticism about fitness and health as I did about education. As hard as it is to become an athlete at 50+, let me just say, it\u2019s just as hard to develop expertise in a new field of knowledge.  So for this and a million other reasons (and a couple of really specific reasons -- some dangerous dumb shit I've seen folks blog about recently, truth be told), I\u2019m returning to education technology criticism -- it\u2019s what I know. It\u2019s what I\u2019m good at. (Or at least some people tell me that.) I lost my son, but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll go quietly and let the techno-libertarian fantasies strip the future from the rest of us. I have just started working on a book on artificial intelligence and education. A little bit of history -- we have been building \u201cintelligent tutors\u201d for decades now. Indeed what we consider \u201cintelligence\u201d is wrapped up in the history of education and testing (and eugenics -- probably worth pointing out). A little bit of science -- what do we know about how humans learn, and is this anything akin to \u201cmachine learning\u201d? (Or has computer science shaped how we conceive of the mind?) A lot of technology criticism and literary analysis -- why are these stories about robot teachers so compelling? My plan right now is a collection of essays akin to the sorts of provocations that I\u2019d once give as a speaker. Monsters of Ed-Tech: Back from the Dead. Or something. I don\u2019t plan to update Hack Education regularly. And since we\u2019ve fucked up the Web, I don\u2019t even know if folks will see this update or notice that anything has changed here. But if you stumble across this blog post, know that I do send out a newsletter, Second Breakfast, and there I\u2019ll share some of my thoughts on AI and bodies and brains. (No, it's not free or \"open\" -- because that whole thing, as AI is showing us, is an absolute joke.)  Published 05 Oct 2024 ...",

Here\u2019s how it works.\n There are plans to open the world's first permanent museum for AI art next year. Dataland, which is the brainchild of new media artist Refik Anadol, will be a 20,000 square-foot space that sits alongside galleries such as MOCA in the famed Frank Gehry-designed Grand L.A development, a culture hotspot in Los Angeles, California. Anadol describes Dataland, which will host digital artworks and installations expressed through its own Large Nature Model (LNM), as a place \"where human imagination meets the creative potential of machines\". Refik Anadol Studio's Large Nature Model is the world's first open source AI model based solely on nature data. The model is trained on data secured by permission from partners, including millions of specimens, objects, images and sounds from the Smithsonian, London\u2019s Natural History Museum and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, in addition to another half a billion images of nature. The resulting multi-dimensional data visualization installations are mesmerizing and immersive, a \"living museum made of pixels and voxels\". You can see an example below. Not only is the Large Nature Model's data ethically collected (as opposed to scraping data without permission, which is the approach of many AI image generators), but it is run on Google servers in Oregon that only use renewable energy, leading Anadol to label his model 'ethical AI'. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Anadol says, \u201cWe are blending Gehry\u2019s building with AI\u2019s infrastructure and technology, and this never-seen-before art form\u201d. He also explains that he is still working out what to call this new art form. It's \"not AR, not VR, not XR... the best name so far, and people love it, is generative reality.\u201d So is GR the future of art?

A post shared by DATALAND.ART (@datalandmuseum) A photo posted by on  For at least two years there has a been a tidal wave of AI-generated images hitting the mainstream photography world. An AI-generated image tricked judges to win a photo contest, and I spoke with award winning artists and photo contest organizers who had mixed feelings about AI in the art world. Some feel the rise of AI, especially in the arts, equates to the demise of what makes us human, while others are open minded about AI's role in creativity. Anadol is more than open minded. He embraces AI, describing its role in art to the Los Angeles Times as a \"co-creator and co-being\". His fascinating artwork isn't just the result of a few word prompts into a generator, created using anyone's data without their knowledge. Data is ethically sourced from partners and painstakingly labeled. In one example Anadol says they have 75 million flowers, which took a year to label, all of which are available for other artists and researchers to use too. The Dataland team also personally collects data from unique locations around the world, such as rainforests, using various technologies including LiDAR, photogrammetry, ambisonic audio, high-resolution images and even scents. Anadol's practice makes for a compelling antidote to the all-too-often sinister and unethical use of AI in art. It's a multi-sensory art form with the power to educate that some fans are even labeling a 'movement'. I'm relatively open minded about AI in art, though I prefer to celebrate human creativity, but I haven't embraced AI and its presence in my daily life with the same passion as Anadol. However, his concepts have opened my mind to the positive ways AI can be used for creative purposes, and I'm super keen to check out Dataland, whenever it opens next year.

            "content": "A new exhibition by artists and musicians Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst at London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery explores the potential of collaborative artmaking in the age of artificial intelligence Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst conducting a recording session with London Contemporary Voices, 2024 A new exhibition in London delves deep into the potential of collaborative artmaking in the age of artificial intelligence. Staged at the Serpentine North gallery, this engaging and highly intriguing show invites viewers to reflect on ways in which technology is reshaping the creative process while also addressing pressing societal concerns around AI. A collaborative project between artists and musicians, two of the most influential artists working in AI, Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, and Serpentine Arts Technologies, \u201cThe Call\u201d draws on the age-old practices and rituals of community musical groups, namely choir singers, to explore the possibilities of co-creating with the machine. Simultaneously, the exhibition dabbles with the question of data ownership in the era of AI\u2014investigating how we might build collaborative datasets that are collectively owned and governed. This is about nurturing the mind of AI to be a better machine. At the heart of the exhibition is the collective creation of new vocal datasets\u2014polyphonic AI models designed to handle and generate multiple distinct elements simultaneously. The result is an immersive experience where human and machine voices intertwine, drawing the audience into the choir\u2014at times making them part of the performance itself. \"The Call\" at Serpentine gallerydraws on the age-old practices and rituals of choral singing For Herndon and Dryhurst, AI is a creative instrument. If guided well, then it will perform well. The artists view every process of AI training as part of the art making, so rather than ask if AI will replace the artist, they are saying how can we as artists create art with AI collaboratively to benefit both parties. This is where community choir groups play a vital role. While they seem far removed from the cold mechanics of AI, Herndon and Dryhurst see the warmth, sense of belonging, and the collective processes\u2014group support, camaraderie, rituals of call-and-response\u2014educating AI to follow a more collaborative path. For millennia such rituals have helped make spaces for gathering and building social and civic meaning, so why not teach and encourage the machine to think similarly. Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst \"The Call\" at Serpentine with installation design by sub architecture studio To train the AI models, Herndon and Dryhurst composed a songbook of hymns and vocal exercises, performed by fifteen ensembles and captured using a multi-channel recording protocol. The choral dataset tour was held in spring 2024 and spanned across the UK to cities from Belfast in Ireland to Leeds and Bristol. In the Serpentine gallery, multi-channel audios let visitors immerse themselves in these performances, experiencing firsthand how community dynamics might inform AI\u2019s future. What\u2019s possibly more intriguing is how the artists are seeing this as an opportunity to intervene and explore governance frameworks. Part of the experiment involves recording choral music and incorporating these voices into AI models. But the path also raises deeper questions: How can individuals and groups collectively own their data and control its use\u2014whether to share it freely or charge for it? Central to this vision is the role of a data trustee, ensuring that both individual and collective rights are upheld. To illustrate how everything functions, the Serpentine gallery has been transformed into a machine, with each zone representing a different aspect of AI learning. The space is both educational and interactive, designed to demystify machine learning by offering visitors hands-on exploration of its processes. It\u2019s really about taking the scary edge off AI so we can all take part in it\u2019s educational future. To train the AI models, Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst composed a songbook of hymns and vocal exercises As we plunge ever-deeper into the unknown AI future, understanding how it works and taking ownership of the journey by engaging with the data is critical. This is something Serpentine has been investigating for the past decade with Serpentine Arts Technologies. Likewise, Herndon and Dryhurst see actively and consciously shaping the training data as essential in how we will drive the next generation of AI models. Herndon says the exhibition has deepened her appreciation for the archive. She highlights how, once something is captured in media\u2014whether as an audio file, video, or photograph\u2014it becomes machine-readable and could potentially be used in a training set. By recognizing the generative potential of each piece of media, the artists are therefore able to handle the dataset with greater care. \u201cThe Call\u201d is no ordinary exhibition. Rather, this is a live research project, a vibrant discussion that uses a seemingly simple concept to help untangle the complexities of a world where humans and AI will be living side-by-side. Essentially, Herdnon and Dryhurst are imagining the art institution as a laboratory for discovering new technologies through an artist-led AI system. The AI choral model where viewers can experience a personal call-and-response with the machine \u201cWith \u2018The Call,\u2019 we're offering a beautiful way to make AI. We\u2019re thinking of the creation of the data, the training of the model, and its output all as works of art,\u201d says Herndon. In recent years, the Serpentine gallery has presented an array of exhibitions exploring future-facing art. Together, they have been weaving an exciting story around the critical role of the artist and art institution in the age of machine intelligence. As Hans Ulrich Obrist, Serpentine\u2019s artistic director, says: artists have the power to make the invisible visible. Spending time cocooned in the Serpentine North gallery space, exploring my own shaky voice through the AI choral model and experiencing a personal call-and-response with the machine, and then being treated to soul-warming live choral performance by the Hive Choir from Belfast, I\u2019m feeling less anxious about an AI takeover. Herdnon and Dryhurst are questioning and contemplating so many of our concerns with how to be human in the age of the machine\u2014or better what is humanness as we race towards this unknown world. And it is a strangely human show that addresses such a non-human medium, beautifully conceived and packed with wonderful sensory experiences.

            "content": "How ChatGPT Voice Has Made The World More Accessible Yesterday, I had the pleasure of joining a few hundred educators in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, to keynote their event celebrating World Teachers' Day. What made this occasion truly special was the presence of representatives from their student digital champions program. During my talk, I invited an 11-year-old student to join me on stage to demonstrate the new Advanced Voice feature of ChatGPT. What happened blew my mind. The student and I decided to have a conversation, him speaking Dutch and me speaking English, with ChatGPT acting as our live translator. The AI facilitated a seamless dialogue between us. We understood each other perfectly, bridging the language barrier effortlessly. The world is getting smaller and a lot more accessible thanks to AI. This experience embodies the transformative potential of AI in educational settings. Tools such as ChatGPT's Advanced Voice mode are poised to enhance the learning experience. Dan with the Stichting Best Onderwijs student digital champions The new feature in ChatGPT enables users to engage in natural, flowing audio conversations with the AI chatbot. It harnesses GPT-4o's audio capabilities to facilitate real-time interactions that closely mimic human conversation. It is available to ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers via the mobile app. Advanced Voice mode can understand context, respond to emotions and maintain coherent dialogues even when interrupted. The journey of Advanced Voice mode has not been without controversy. Its launch was delayed because of concerns over the use of a voice that closely resembled actress Scarlett Johansson's. The incident sparked a debate about the ethics of AI voice cloning. OpenAI removed the controversial voice and issued an apology. Although OpenAI have rolled out this new feature, its availability is restricted in certain regions, such as EU countries, due to regulations on AI models that can detect emotions. To start a conversation with Advanced Voice mode, you simply need to tap the Voice icon in the ChatGPT app. A blue orb appears on the screen during the interaction and you start talking to it. It's worth noting that there is a daily query limit for subscribers. The integration of ChatGPT's Advanced Voice mode into educational settings could lead to a significant leap forward in personalized and accessible learning. OpenAI have now offered it to developers. This will likely pave the way for education based technology companies to start integrating in their own products. It's crucial to approach its implementation thoughtfully. Educators and institutions must consider issues of data privacy, the digital divide and the importance of maintaining human connections in the learning process. AI-powered tools like ChatGPT's Advanced Voice mode will play an increasingly important role in education. By embracing these technologies responsibly and creatively, we can create more engaging, accessible and effective learning experiences for students of all ages and backgrounds. The future of learning is looking to be more conversational, personalized and powered by AI. We're not just talking about the future of learning; we're speaking it into existence with tools like ChatGPT's Advanced Voice mode. As the technology continues to evolve, it will likely reshape how we interact with the digital aspects of our lives. The challenge ahead lies in harnessing this powerful tool to create a more knowledgeable, skilled and connected global society.  One Community.

            "content": "If the \"doom loop\" has you caged with anxiety, there's a way out. The rise in AI has caused a mixture of excitement and fear as it becomes a standard part of our lives. Some say it\u2019s a risk to the fabric of humanity, while others insist it\u2019s revolutionizing the way we work, live and interact with one another. Elon Musk referred to ChatGPT as, \u201cOne of the biggest risks to the future of civilization,\u201d when he spoke at the 2023 World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. That same year Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, urged lawmakers to regulate artificial intelligence, worried that it could be used in ways that can cause significant harm to the world. The part that is not debatable is that AI is on the upswing. Moving too fast and in the wrong direction, could AI surpass regulation and cause significant harm to the world? Since AI has no moral compass, there are concerns about how organizations might use it in their human resource management practices to treat employees\u2014as an asset or a liability? The so-called \u201cdoom loop\u201d is a growing anxiety among the workforce that AI will take over their jobs. Employees are worried about what new technology could mean for their roles, which is stressing them out and affecting how they work. Meanwhile, companies are going all-in on AI, spending big and hoping for significant productivity boosts. The gap between what employees fear and their bosses expect is creating a tense loop that business leaders need to address. Salesforce, Inc. could be the first company to actualize the fears of many Americans that AI is usurping their jobs. The facts are clear, according to Dan Parsons, co-founder of Thoughtful AI, that customer service workers are being replaced by AI agents across all companies, specifically in healthcare. He asserts that AI is simply more efficient and productive than humans in these roles. They are also cheaper and can work nonstop. \u201cIt's true that AI will replace roles in healthcare, we should welcome and embrace this evolution as the shift comes at a critical time,\u201d Parsons says. \u201cThe healthcare industry is facing a staffing crisis, where high turnover rates and difficulty in hiring are common challenges. AI transformations are necessary for providers who want to get ahead and future proof their organizations.\u201d Many fortune 500 companies are replacing customer service workers with AI agents, which creates the need for employees to diversify their skillset and lean into more soft skills. Moving forward, Matt Kirk, owner of Talent Acquisition Solutions at SHL, believes many companies will be looking for people they can teach and mold, employees that are willing to learn. \u201cAI is predicted to take away or to really take over a lot of the kind of efficiencies and the processes,\u201d Kirk explains. \u201cThe vast majority of people in those roles are likely to lose their jobs in the next few years, and those jobs will be replaced with new jobs. That's one of the reasons why the skills piece is important, because as AI forces new roles and changes the structure of organization, external talent is hard to find and it's expensive.\u201d I spoke by email with Keith Bigelow, chief product officer at Visier. \"The integration of AI into the workplace is reshaping industries and redefining roles, creating both excitement and anxiety,\u201d Bigelow told me. \u201cIts impact is centered squarely around the employee, so as companies embrace AI, it's essential for HR to play a key role alongside technology and business leaders. By prioritizing the employee experience from the start, HR can help alleviate concerns about job security and enhance morale during this transition.\u201d He suggests five ways to close the \u201cdoom loop.\u201d  One Community.

            "content": "by Michael Levanduski  Facial recognition technology has been around for quite a while now. Over the years, it has gotten a lot better as well. Today it is commonly used to unlock your phone, make secure purchases, and by law enforcement to track people in public areas. According to several studies, however, facial recognition software, especially when combined with artificial intelligence (AI) software, can do a lot more than that, and it is a little scary. Michael Kosinski, a Stanford University psychologist, conducted an interview with Business Insider where he claims that the latest developments in facial scanning software can accurately predict your political beliefs, your intelligence, and even some very personal desires that you may want kept private. In a 2021 study he published, he showed that the facial recognition model he was using was able to predict a person\u2019s political positions with 72% accuracy. This was simply from feeding a photograph into the system. Humans, according to the study, could only predict it with 55% accuracy, which is barely over random chance.  In the study he warns that while this technology is very impressive, people need to be careful with what it can do. He explained: \u201cGiven the widespread use of facial recognition, our findings have critical implications for the protection of privacy and civil liberties.\u201d With people\u2019s opinions on just about every subject imaginable being very polarizing today, it is easy to see how this type of technology could be used negatively. Governments or companies could scan people to determine their sexual orientation, political beliefs, religious beliefs, and much more. As of now, the systems Kosinski reported on are not 100% accurate, but they are significantly better than chance. In some situations, that would be enough for an oppressive government to take action or at least perform additional investigations on the person in question.  While the cat is out of the bag when it comes to both facial recognition and artificial intelligence, it is important to be aware of these types of possibilities so they won\u2019t be used against people in the future. Facial recognition and AI software is getting scary.

Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.

As technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Bernstein analysts, led by Toni Sacconaghi, recently penned an investor note on the AI space, noting that the potential for continued strong Gen-AI training dynamics was likely constructive for NVIDIA at this point, though questions around the pace and trajectory of Gen-AI inference, however, may come more at the expense of their peers who have broadly acknowledged NVIDIA's training dominance and have hence focused on inference as the bulk of their long-term opportunity. Per Bernstein, leading LLM builders were already pre-buying NVIDIA's Blackwell to prepare for next-generation models. Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In the US, an ACH transfer through the Fed can take three days (most of which is banks just sitting on the transferred funds to earn their own interest). To do faster, you need to pay an Electronic Payments Network like Fiserv.PayPal has press releases saying they partner with Fiserv. But that\u00e2(TM)s still someone else collecting the money for transaction fees. By operating their own stablecoin, they can participate in the processing network  (Ethereum & Solana) and receive transaction fees. Now the  Do they have something secure enough to protect their wallets' private keys?  HSMs are one thing, but AFAIK, there is no HSM rated to protect a key holding a billion dollars worth of money, something so high that nation-states will get involved and try flipping employees.  The technology and infrastructure just isn't here to protect extremely high value keys like this. In the US, an ACH transfer through the Fed can take three daysSince 2022 you can transfer money up to $1m within the same day using Fast ACH: https://www.nacha.org/resource...

Services like FedNow and ACH RTP are nearly instantaneous and have a much lower overhead cost than a trip through \"stablecoin\". The limits are $500,000 for FedNow and $1 million for RTP.

An exchange within the same crypto exchange doesn't require a ledger entry. IIRC, that's how CoinBase does it with their payment service. Stablecoins make a lot of money for the maker.  For example: Bob makes his coin, pegged to the dollar, 1:1.  He gets ten people to trade a buck for a Bobcoin.  He now has $10.  He also can mint more Bobcoins, because he knows not everyone is going to want their dollar back, so he can spend 100 Bobcoins, and there is a good chance, not everyone will want to turn their Bobcoins back into dollars.  However, if it happens, well, people who bought Bobcoins are screwed.  This is exactly like how banks were, where  Every time I see this copy/paste, I have the urge to make a smug post about how BTC will be $100,000 by the end of the year, which will trigger someone mocking Pyrate Pete and links to postings from a few years ago. However, it would be nice if cryptocurrency just dies.  The tulips have wilted.  Nobody cares about blockchain anymore.  The Lambos have been purchased, and the whales have cashed out, although it is likely some people's 401ks have bought into BTC, which is why it is at ~$60k as of today.

This would play well as a double feature with Alex Winter's excellent doc Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain a few years back. \"In the future of money, who holds the power?\" Indeed. In Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, intrepid filmmaker Cullen Hoback dives into the origins of Bitcoin and the identity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The captivating new doc film offers a thrilling, globe-spanning investigation, with Hoback immersing himself with key players, uncovering never-before-seen clues, and humorously unraveling Bitcoin's meteoric rise. It's executive produced by Adam McKay (director of The Big Short), Todd Schulman, Cullen Hoback, and Taylor Jones. And it'll be streaming on Max later this month. I'm always fascinated by these kind of investigations, but they're never critical enough or hard-hitting when it comes to the danger of a world obsessed with crypto. We still have to keep waiting to see what comes next. Official trailer for Cullen Hoback's doc Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, from HBO's YouTube:   Intrepid filmmaker Cullen Hoback dives into one of the most enduring, high-stakes mysteries in tech and finance: the origins of Bitcoin and the identity of its anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. More than a decade after Satoshi's disappearance, Bitcoin now threatens to disrupt the global financial order, forcing nations to reconsider the very nature of money as Satoshi potentially stands to become the richest person on earth. Known for uncovering clandestine subcultures and movements through digital forensics, Hoback immerses himself with key players, uncovers never-before-seen clues, and humorously unravels Bitcoin\u2019s chaotic origins and meteoric rise. Money Electric offers a thrilling, globe-spanning investigation into the intentions of Bitcoin's enigmatic inventor. Hoback encounters those who could be Satoshi, seeking to reveal who holds the power \u2014 and what they might do with it if Bitcoin were woven into our daily lives. Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery is directed by investigative filmmaker Cullen Hoback, director of the movies Monster Camp, Friction, Terms and Conditions May Apply, Do Not Pass Go, as well as What Lies Upstream previously, plus the \"Q: Into the Storm\" doc mini-series recently. It's produced by Jessie Deeter, Scott Holroyd, and Alina Solodnikova. A Hyrax Films Production in association with HyperObject Industries and Hello Pictures. HBO will debut the doc film Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery streaming on Max starting on October 8th, 2024 this fall. Anyone want to watch this doc? And where is Nakamoto hiding?

            "content": "Representation of Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies are seen in this illustration photo taken in ... [+] Krakow, Poland on September 18, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Bitcoin is the first, most popular, and biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, many Bitcoin advocates draw a sharp contrast between bitcoin and the broader \u201ccrypto\u201d space. Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy and a bitcoin bull, voiced this on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" He said, \"Speaking for all the bitcoiners, we feel trapped in a bad relationship with crypto, and we want out.\" Why such a stark divide between terms that appear closely related both linguistically and technologically? After all, every cryptocurrency is built on blockchain \u2014 a technology that allows transferring digital assets through a decentralized network, which maintains and updates the ever-growing transactions ledger. The essence of \u201cbitcoin, not crypto\u201d lies in the concept of decentralization. So far, no blockchain can compete with Bitcoin in this respect. However, we may still reconcile this perspective with the existence of other blockchains by recognizing the different purposes they serve. Decentralization is a solution to avoiding central authority flaws. Bitcoin is revolutionary in achieving a truly decentralized value transfer system, based on cryptology and economic incentive \u2014 new bitcoin and transaction fees paid to the miners. In return, miners invest in specialized hardware and spend a lot of electricity. They do this to find proof-of-work for each block, thus securing the blockchain. Miners are motivated to keep Bitcoin safe, operating, and most importantly, censorship-resistant. An alternative to PoW is proof-of-stake, which requires validators to stake the blockchain\u2019s currency to prove their good intentions. This consensus and its variations are now the most popular among blockchains, as they allow for higher scalability. However, PoS can create an oligarchic system. The more coins you stake, the higher your chances of adding a block and earning a reward. This makes you wealthier, allowing you to stake more coins. Unlike bitcoin miners, whose power remains unchanged after mining a block, PoS validators can grow their influence. Furthermore, centralization concerns extend beyond the PoS consensus. A small number of nodes, liquid staking protocols pooling user funds, nodes hosted by centralized services, high hardware requirements, and centralization risks related to MEV (maximal extractable value) practices are just some of the problems that most blockchains must face. On Ethereum, one of the most decentralized blockchains other than Bitcoin, nearly 35% of staked coins come from the top three decentralized liquid staking services, according to Dune Analytics. Another 20% come from the top three centralized services. Additionally, 69% of Ethereum nodes are hosted by three centralized providers, and 90% of the blocks are ordered by just three MEV-optimizing builders. With 1.16 TB, Ethereum blockchain weighs almost twice as much as Bitcoin (604 GB), making participation harder for average users. Yes, most blockchains are much less decentralized and therefore less censorship-resistant than Bitcoin. Moreover, unlike Bitcoin, which Satoshi Nakamoto handed to the community less than two years after its launch, most other blockchains are still tied to their founders. This group of insiders, including early investors, often retains significant control, notably through pre-minted coins. This further concentrates their wealth and power. Does this mean that the whole \u201ccrypto\u201d space is useless? It may be too early to say that. Decentralization is a spectrum, and even less decentralized platforms still offer users more freedom and control than traditional web services. This gives them the potential to serve various use cases beyond money. Bitcoin\u2019s primary goal is to create and sustain independent money. As more people place their trust in bitcoin as an alternative to traditional currencies, its value grows accordingly. In contrast, most other blockchains, like Ethereum or Solana, were designed as multi-purpose smart contract platforms. Their goal is to enable the development of decentralized applications, called dapps. Using these blockchains, the next phase of the internet, known as Web3, could enable innovative use cases ranging from gaming and social media to finance, commerce, and beyond. In this perspective, ether, the native coin of Ethereum, is not a cryptocurrency. While it can be invested in or traded, ether is more of a utility asset for Web3 than general-purpose money. Its primary role is to power the Ethereum blockchain, functioning as payment for transactions and an incentive for validators. As Ethereum-based dapps gain popularity, demand for ether increases to cover transaction costs. Also, smart contract platforms\u2019 founding teams often operate much like traditional companies. They deal with issues like finding investment, solving technical problems, building communities, and marketing their products. The value of these blockchains' native coins reflects the quality of this work, distancing them from the notion of independent currency. In the Web3 space, many consider such an organization necessary to innovate, and it\u2019s hard to disagree. However, efficiency at the expense of decentralization goes against the cypherpunk ethos. This further increases the divide between Bitcoin and crypto. Web3 is buzzing with activity. Yet, according to DappRadar, the top 15 blockchains collectively register only 165 million unique active wallets per month. The future of the space will likely hinge on finding the right balance between decentralization and innovation. It will also depend on the teams\u2019 ability to pass on their projects to the community when the time comes. Beyond native coins like bitcoin and ether, blockchains host a wide array of tokens, each with different functions and levels of decentralization. These tokens include stablecoins, memecoins, protocol tokens, and all sorts of digital units that anyone can easily create using a smart contract. The tokens share the blockchain environment with native coins, but their value depends on the project that issued them. For years, the tokens fueled bitcoin maximalists\u2019 disdain for all crypto but bitcoin. Numerous crypto scams, mostly involving such tokens, have caused significant reputational damage to the crypto space. They have even tarnished bitcoin in the process. With the introduction of Ordinals and Runes, some bitcoiners have reconsidered their stance on tokens. These protocols, which assign value to satoshis (bitcoin\u2019s smallest units) or create tokens on Bitcoin, have sparked discussions about new use cases for the blockchain. However, following the initial hype, both protocols now see only modest usage. Since their peak in 2023, daily Ordinals inscriptions have dropped from over 400,000 to around 40,000. Runes etchings have fallen from over 35,000 in April to fewer than 400. So far, bitcoin's role as a better form of money is its main use, overshadowing any other. In short, bitcoin remains unmatched in its decentralization and primary role as an alternative form of money. Meanwhile, the broader crypto space is willing to compromise decentralization for innovation and new use cases. As a result, bitcoin and crypto are growing increasingly distinct.  One Community.

In the first phase, the product debuts with a fixed 30-day 10% annualized yield with daily redemption features on assets and yield, with assets capped at $100 million at the beginning. The protocol plans a broader rollout in the first quarter of 2025, raising the maximum capacity to $500 million and offering a 90-day fixed yield of 15% annualized. On top of the yield, both retail and institutional investors may earn rewards for participating in the Plume ecosystem. The underlying assets are diversified across on-chain \"high quality liquid assets,\" collateralized on-chain lending and high yield trade financing solutions underwritten by loan originators focusing on small and mid-size businesses. Private credit has been one of the first frontiers of crypto's RWA tokenization movement, a process that brings traditional financial instruments such as bonds, commodities and funds to blockchain rails in pursuit of efficiency, transparency and accessibility gains. The blockchain-based private credit market currently stands at $9 billion, rwa.xyz data shows, dominated by fintech firm Figure's home equity credit line service using the Provenance blockchain. That's still tiny compared to the booming private credit market in traditional finance, which the IMF estimated to be worth over $2 trillion. Credbull, led by McKinsey alum Jason Dehni as CEO, is one of the newer entrants, aiming to broaden access to high-yield structured products using blockchain tech to cut costs. Its first fund debuted on Polygon this year and is regulated in the Bahamas. The company raised $5.2 million in August in a venture capital round led by GnosisVC. Plume is an Ethereum-based layer-2 blockchain specializing on RWA finance, backed by Galaxy and Haun in a $10 million fundraising round earlier this year. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

The firm relocked the coins in three separate transactions, comprising $500 million, 200 million, and 100 million XRP, respectively.\u00a0 This move came after the firm\u2019s monthly release of 1 billion XRP on October 1. However, XRP\u2019s price reacted negatively to the transaction trend, plummeting by over 7% within the past day.\u00a0 Ripple has relocked 800 million XRP coins in its escrow. According to data from Whale Alert, a prominent on-chain tracker, the company relocked the coins in three separate transactions. Firstly, as of 12:25 pm UTC, Ripple relocked 500 million coins worth about $314.84 million during the transaction period. \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12  500,000,000 #XRP (314,847,284 USD) locked in escrow at #Ripplehttps://t.co/HfohSK0OCG \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 1, 2024  About a minute later, the company locked 100 million XRP tokens worth $62 million in its escrow account. \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12 \ud83d\udd12  200,000,000 #XRP (126,034,510 USD) locked in escrow at #Ripplehttps://t.co/f8APQ8m1W3 \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 1, 2024  The last transaction involved the relock of 200 million XRP coins worth over $126.03 million. Ripple completed this third transaction as of 12:27 UTC. While the first transaction involves Ripple\u2019s account \u201crDdXiA3M4m\u2026UaAXCFWeCK,\u201d the firm used the address \u201crKDvgGUsNP\u20262Not4co2op\u201d for its second and third transactions. The overall relocking process began after Ripple completed its monthly release of 1 billion on October 1. The relocked coins represent 80% of the tokens released for the month. Notably, on October 1, Ripple released its monthly 1 billion XRP tokens for escrow. Whale Alert data shows it also completed the transactions in three different splits: 200 million, 300 million, and 500 million XRP tokens. Following Ripple\u2019s latest unlock and relock pattern, only 200 million XRP coins were added to the circulating supply. Notably, Ripple releases 1 billion XRP monthly and recently started relocking some of them. Though the firm has deviated from maintaining the exact amount of XRP coins in these processes, the pattern remains the same. The relocking process is part of Ripple\u2019s strategy to maintain XRP\u2019s price stability. It also helps the firm manage the overall XRP distribution and boosts investors\u2019 confidence. However, the latest process has impacted the price of XRP. From its daily high of $6336 as of October 1, XRP slipped to $0.5846. XRP trades at $0.5812, reflecting a 5.60% decline over the past 24 hours. It boasts a market cap of $32.99 billion. According to data from Coinglass, on-chain metrics show a bearish sentiment for XRP. The details highlight XRP\u2019s Long/Short ratio at 0.924, with 48% of top traders holding long positions while 52% have short positions. Also, its future open interest dropped by 4.5%, indicating a decline in investor interest.\u00a0 Meanwhile, XRP\u2019s price drop could stem from the bearish trend in the broader crypto market due to tension in the Middle East. Bitcoin has dropped by over 4% to hit $61,168 while Ether\u2019s price hovers at $2,444, indicating an over 5% decline. Your email address will not be published.

It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Binance's registration with the CNV highlights the company's commitment to compliance, in Argentina and worldwide, for the growth and expansion of the crypto industry in a safe and sustainable manner. The news closely follows recent regulatory wins in diverse regions like India, Kazakhstan, and Indonesia, illustrating Binance\u2019s sustained global momentum and adding to previously secured licenses, registrations, and authorizations in jurisdictions like Dubai, France, Japan, El Salvador, and others. Additionally, with this new registration, Binance's website and application are now fully available to Argentine users, providing them with access to Binance's complete suite of services and tools. Guilherme Nazar, Binance's Head of Latin America, said: \u201cAt Binance, we support forward-looking regulation and believe that it is key to ensuring that the industry continues to evolve and that adoption occurs in a safe manner. As an industry leader with licenses and registrations in 20 jurisdictions worldwide, Binance is committed to the development of the crypto ecosystem globally and in Argentina, in compliance with local requirements.\u201d He also noted: \u201cArgentina is a key market for Binance. We will continue to work closely with the authorities to develop the industry in the most sustainable and secure way for the benefit of the crypto community and society as a whole.\u201d In line with its global standards, Binance\u2019s compliance program includes robust anti-money laundering (AML) policies and controls and a comprehensive framework to combat the financing of terrorism (CFT). In addition to rigorous AML and CFT controls, key components of Binance's compliance program include robust identity verification processes (Know Your Customer and Know Your Business, or KYC and KYB) and the industry-leading Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) unit, designed to assist law enforcement in investigating crypto asset-related crimes and capacity building, thereby strengthening the collaborative security of the ecosystem. \u201cBinance's commitment to security and regulation is a fundamental part of our strategy. We are convinced that in this way, we can contribute significantly to the development of the local and global industry, raising standards for the protection of users and creating a transparent and efficient financial environment,\u201d concluded Nazar.

More than 500 transactions were completed during the pilot.\u00a0 According to those firms involved, the collaboration \"demonstrated the ability to create a digital twin of these previously immobile real-world assets (RWAs) and use those tokenized assets as collateral in atomic, real-time transactions\". The project took place at a time when the use of gold as a traded asset has increased with average daily trading volume reaching $162bn worldwide.\u00a0 \u201cWe recognise the immense value in industry experimentation to showcase the advantages of DLT for the market,\" said Olivier Grimonpont, head of product management, market liquidity, Euroclear.\u00a0\"As we strive to deliver even better and faster collateral mobilisation for our clients, digital technologies like DLT will be key enablers for us to achieve this.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOur work with the pilot participants has demonstrated that tokenized assets can be used with immediate effect to meet intraday margin calls outside of normal settlement cycles, processing times, and time zones,\" said Kelly Mathieson, chief business development officer at Digital Asset.\u00a0 \u201cBy digitising gold, we can overcome the perceived restrictions on moving and storing the physical metal, enabling this high-quality asset to be mobilized and used seamlessly within financial markets,\u201d said Mike Oswin, global head of market structure and innovation at the World Gold Council. Law firm Clifford Chance was also involved in the project and commented on the legal implications of using a 'digital twin' of an RWA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith certain approaches and platforms, a digital twin is not a separate asset and so the impact for master agreements, trading relationships, close-out processes, and valuation approaches are minimised, but it is always important to ensure the digital twin is catered for and reflected into existing product and platform documentation,\" said Paul Landless, partner, co-head of Fintech at Clifford Chance. \"As an operational and record-keeping tool rather than an asset, some of the legal and regulatory issues can be reduced while avoiding extensive surgery or a wholesale reset of established product and asset documentation.\u201d\u00a0 \n/security\n \n19 September 2024\n \n/retail\n \n08 August 2024\n \n/predictions\n \n28 June 2024\n \n/crypto\n \n21 March 2024\n \n/markets\n \n12 March 2024\n \n/wholesale\n \n02 November 2023\n Welcome to Finextra.

            "content": "BBVA is the latest financial giant entering the crowded field of stablecoins as the Spanish bank gets set to launch its own digital asset next year with the aid of Visa. In an interview with Fortune, BBVA head of digital assets and blockchain Francisco Maroto said the bank is currently in the sandbox phase of a new Visa program that helps firms launch their own tokenized assets, and wants to reach the prototype phase and live activity by 2025. BBVA has not yet decided whether the stablecoin will be backed by deposits, money market funds, or fiat currencies such as the euro or the U.S. dollar, said Maroto, who added that the company plans for it to be used for the settlement layer on exchanges. BBVA has been working in the digital asset space since 2014, and Maroto hopes that the latest project will let the bank benefit from the growing trend of the tokenization of assets such as real estate and private credit funds. \u201cWe realized that blockchain could transform the way we exchange value digitally, and consequently affect the way the financial system works,\u201d Maroto said. Stablecoins constitute a broad category in the crypto space, describing any asset intended to maintain a specific price and backed by reserves such as fiat currencies, commodities, or even other cryptocurrencies. While the sector has existed for a decade, dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDC and Tether have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with their backing companies earning hefty profits through the yields on the underlying assets, which typically include U.S. Treasuries and other dollar equivalents.  Competitors from the traditional finance space have recently entered the race, including PayPal, which launched its PYUSD stablecoin in August 2023, as well as a bevy of overseas offerings that provide yield to their customers\u2014an option restricted in the U.S. due to regulatory uncertainty. Last week, Visa announced a new product that would allow financial institutions such as banks to launch their own stablecoins, which Visa is calling fiat-backed tokens. While the use cases would vary, the idea would be for banks to choose the type of asset held as the reserve, which could vary from fiat currencies to deposits. While the tokens would initially work only within the bank\u2019s own ecosystem, Visa head of crypto Cuy Sheffield told Fortune in April that the long-term plan would be to facilitate interoperability between different institutions, which is an advantage of more universal stablecoins such as USDC that can work across blockchains. Maroto said that BBVA wanted to work with Visa, rather than choosing an existing stablecoin option, because of Visa\u2019s established brand and regulatory compliance. As one of the first financial institutions to experiment with the new product, BBVA also has the edge of operating mainly in Europe, which recently enacted stablecoin oversight.  Maroto said that BBVA will likely build its stablecoin around the euro, given its European presence, and that it could be used for settlement on exchanges that offer tokenized assets, with BBVA handling the mint and burn mechanism that converts fiat into crypto ecosystems.  Despite the goal of launching live testing next year, Maroto said that the U.S. is not on its short-term time horizon. BBVA currently offers the custody and trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC in Switzerland for private banking and institutional customers and is launching in Turkey.  \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

            "content": "Aptos (APT) soared over 10% in the last 24 hours following Aptos Labs\u2019 acquisition of HashPallete. The token is leading the market after becoming the largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. On Thursday, Aptos Labs, the developer of the Aptos network, announced it had agreed to acquire the Japanese Blockchain developer HashPallete, the company behind Japan\u2019s Palette Chain and a subsidiary of HashPort Inc. The agreement aims to become a \u201cgame changer for Japan and the Aptos ecosystem\u201d as the integration with the Japanese blockchain is set to strengthen its presence in the Asian market: Japan has long been a hub of technological innovation, and it\u2019s no different when it comes to blockchain. The country\u2019s unique blend of advanced tech and widespread blockchain adoption makes it a model for Web3 initiatives globally. Today, we\u2019re making one of our boldest strategic moves into this market with our agreement to acquire HashPalette Inc. As part of the acquisition, HashPort Inc. will migrate the Pallete Chain and its subsidiary\u2019s applications to the Aptos Network. The Japanese chain will also have access to the Aptos ecosystem\u2019s security, scalability, and developer tools. The migration is expected to be completed by early 2025, in time for the EXPO2025 DIGITAL WALLET. Moreover, Aptos Labs partnered with HashPort to support local developers, NFT creators, and enterprises by \u201ccontinuing to build blockchain solutions (\u2026) using Aptos Network\u2019s infrastructure.\u201d Following the announcement, APT\u2019s price saw a daily 11% surge, jumping to the $8.66 resistance level before retracing to the $8.51 mark. This performance crowned the token as the leading crypto amid the market retrace. APT is among the few cryptocurrencies recording green numbers in most timeframes among the top 100 tokens by market cap. The altcoin registers a 7.5% and a 41% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Additionally, its daily market volume soared 41.7%, reaching a $769.6 million trading volume in the last 24 hours. The token\u2019s performance was highlighted by several crypto analysts, who considered that APT has the \u201cmost interesting chart\u201d at the moment. According to Yuriy from BikoTrading, the cryptocurrency looks strong as the rising trading volume and the price performance \u201csigns for continued growth.\u201d The trader noted that APT\u2019s price held above the key resistance zone amid the market retrace, which sent the token above Q3\u2019s range highs. Similarly, crypto trader Osbrah stated that APT has been \u201csecretly climbing its way to the most interesting alts charts.\u201d He pointed out that, after October 1\u2019s market sweep, the token had a \u201cclean bullish retest\u201d above the $8 mark. To the trader, the next big resistance is at the $9 mark, which could send APT\u2019s price to the $7.95 support zone if it fails to reclaim it. Meanwhile, another market watcher suggested that the altcoin\u2019s performance could be close to a breakout. Per the post, SUI and APT moved in a \u201ccatch-up trade\u201d path for the past year, moving closely together until SUI decoupled in early 2024. This led to a 44-day lagging period for APT before it followed SUI\u2019s movements. After that, APT rose 98% to its yearly high of $18.8 in mid-March. Now, APT has seen a 32-day lagging period after SUI decoupled again in September, showing \u201cincredible amounts of strength.\u201d Based on this, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could follow SUI\u2019s trajectory and kickstart a massive rally in the next two weeks if history repeats.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn\u2019t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money.  After the failure of her home country\u2019s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar\u2019s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies \u00ad\u2013or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school\u2019s marching band.  She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages \u00ad\u2013 currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats \u2013hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

            "content": "In a significant move that could reshape the regulatory landscape for XRP and blockchain payments company Ripple, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Wednesday that it is appealing the court ruling limiting its authority over crypto markets.\u00a0 The appeal targets a July 2023 decision by US District Judge Analisa Torres, which determined that the XRP token, sold by Ripple Labs on public exchanges, does not qualify as a security under existing laws. The implications of this ruling are substantial. Judge Torres stated that the approximately $757 million in XRP sales on public exchanges did not fall under the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction, thereby exempting these transactions from the investor protection laws the agency enforces.\u00a0 If the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upholds this interpretation, it could hinder the SEC\u2019s ability to regulate other cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase, and challenge the agency\u2019s oversight of newer financial products that do not fit traditional definitions. However, the ruling was not entirely favorable for Ripple. Torres also ruled that roughly $728 million of XRP sales to institutional investors should be classified as securities, requiring compliance with relevant laws.\u00a0 The SEC had originally sought a hefty $2 billion fine against Ripple, but Torres ultimately imposed a $125 million penalty, which is currently on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed his frustration at the SEC\u2019s decision to appeal, calling it \u201cmisguided\u201d and \u201cinfuriating.\u201d He emphasized that despite the ongoing legal challenges, the current legal status of XRP as a non-security is established: If Gensler and the SEC were rational, they would have moved on from this case long ago. It certainly hasn\u2019t protected investors and instead has damaged the credibility and reputation of the SEC. While we\u2019ll fight in court for as long as we need, let\u2019s be clear: XRP\u2019s status as a non-security is the law of the land today. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5390, down 10% after the SEC appealed the judge\u2019s ruling on Wednesday.\u00a0 Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com Ronaldo is an experienced crypto enthusiast dedicated to the nascent and ever-evolving industry.

            "content": "Crypto activity is dynamic, and with over two million tokens (and growing), it is hard to know precisely which of these coins will pump and on which network. Admittedly, meme coins have been dominating headlines, especially on Solana. From MooDeng to Bonk and Pepe, traders are on the lookout. In the past week, eyes have been on Sui Network, a modern blockchain that claims to process over 50,000 transactions every second (TPS) and is faster than Solana. The spike in activity results from the success of what\u2019s arguably one of the largest meme coins in its ecosystem. After launching nearly six days ago, Sudeng (HIPPO) is on fire, posting impressive higher highs. The surge over this time has pushed HIPPO\u2019s market cap and, thus liquidity, higher, looking at swaps at Sui Network\u2018s decentralized exchange, Cetus 4. Changing hands at over $0.010 means traders who got in early, choosing to HODL on and not getting concerned with the sell-off across major markets like Bitcoin could be neck-dip in profits. According to trackers, one meme coin trader is regretting after exiting early, dumping HIPPO for a small profit. On launch, the trader sold 258 SUI, worth around $433, for 1.8 billion HIPPO. This is nearly 20% of the total supply standing at 10 billion. However, the trader chose to sell all this stash for 6,299 SUI days later, racking in nearly $11,000. The problem is, if the trader had chosen to wait, even for another 36 hours, it would have turned out to be major gains. As of October 4, the 1.8 billion HIPPO, is now worth over $25 million. \u00a0 The premature decision to sell is proving costly and is a missed opportunity. All the same, the trader shouldn\u2019t be blamed. The $11,000 earned represents a more than 200X gain.  Moreover, even if the trader would have held on, becoming a diamond hand and waiting for prices to rally, it would have been tough for the trader to exit all at once. HIPPO is not very liquid, and looking at ownership from SuiScan, one address controls over 7.6 billion tokens, which is more than 76% of the total supply.   If the trader held on, the address would be the second largest. Any attempt to sell would force prices lower, triggering panic as other holders scramble to the exits. Currently, traders will be closely monitoring how HIPPO performs. As a meme coin, much depends on hype and whether there is a fear of missing out (FOMO). If that\u2019s the case, the meme coin will float higher, outperforming SUI, which is also relatively firm. Dalmas, a seasoned crypto reporter, brings a unique perspective to the industry.

Dalmas is also the founder of BTC-Pulse, a crypto news site, further demonstrating his commitment to the field. He firmly believes that DeFi and NFTs are here to stay and will continue to drive financial inclusion. Coming from Nairobi, Kenya, it is easy to see the source of his inspiration: Across Africa, millions lack access to traditional banks. Remote villages, limited documentation, and high minimum balances create insurmountable barriers. DeFi, not just Maker or Aave, for example, but think of Bitcoin and USDT, cuts out the middleman. Forget banks with their limitations.\nEven so, DeFi isn't a magic solution. The continent still struggles with reliable internet access, and educational campaigns highlighting the benefits of this wonderful solution are insufficient. Moreover, even for those interested, understanding DeFi can look like learning a new language. Dalmas is here to help make the tech easy to understand and digestible, even for beginners.\nThe story of DeFi in Africa is still being written. Challenges abound, but the promise of a more inclusive financial future is a powerful motivator.

            "content": "The recent Chang hard fork upgrade in September has positioned the Cardano (ADA) blockchain as the top player in the crypto ecosystem, according to its founder, Charles Hoskinson.\u00a0 Hoskinson, who is also known for his role in co-founding Ethereum (ETH), has consistently praised Cardano\u2019s progress over the past month following the recent upgrade, asserting its superiority over the largest cryptocurrencies on the market such as Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of decentralization. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson reaffirmed Cardano\u2019s status, claiming it is \u201cstill number 1.\u201d This statement follows his remarks at the Token2049 Conference in Singapore, where he discussed the new governance model of the Cardano network.\u00a0 Hoskinson emphasized that this model \u201credistributes power\u201d from a select few to the broader community, addressing a key concern he sees with Ethereum\u2019s \u201ccentralized structure.\u201d\u00a0 Hoskinson pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s reliance on its founder, Vitalik Buterin, creates \u201ca bottleneck for innovation,\u201d whereas Cardano\u2019s Chang hard fork has established a framework that ensures ongoing development regardless of individual involvement. Hoskinson further highlighted how delegated representatives (DReps) can now engage with one another, vote, and utilize a blockchain-based governance system to regularly ratify the network\u2019s roadmap. He stated emphatically, \u201cCharles, alive or dead, doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s still going to be innovation on a daily basis.\u201d In addition, the Cardano blockchain has shown significant growth in key metrics, boasting over 74,000 Plutus scripts and the creation of 1.3 million delegated wallets over the last seven years.\u00a0 Additionally, approximately 1,373 projects have been launched on the platform, as highlighted in a commemorative video by Input Output Global (IOG), the development company behind the blockchain. In his latest social media update, Hoskinson also remarked on Cardano\u2019s advancements in decentralized governance, suggesting that the network is on the cusp of achieving remarkable milestones with upcoming features. Looking ahead, Cardano aims to replace its initial genesis keys, which have been instrumental in managing the network since its inception. This transition will be supported by increased participation from stake pool operators (SPOs) and DReps, as well as the establishment of a Constitutional Committee (CC). The next steps toward achieving a fully decentralized governance model involve ensuring that stake pool nodes meet operational thresholds and that decentralized applications (DApps) are nearing completion.\u00a0 The final transition to the Voltaire era, signifying a fully self-sustaining blockchain, will occur with the final use of the Genesis keys, triggering another hard fork. However, further announcements and dates for these developments have yet to be released by IOG or the blockchain\u2019s founder. At the time of writing, Cardano\u2019s native token ADA trades at $0.352, recording a 2% price surge in the last 24 hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com Ronaldo is an experienced crypto enthusiast dedicated to the nascent and ever-evolving industry.

            "content": "The cryptocurrency market is presently experiencing a substantial decline, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced a substantial decrease in active addresses. This trend, which has persisted throughout 2024, has triggered apprehension regarding the future of these prominent cryptocurrencies. The implications for market dynamics could be profound as investor enthusiasm diminishes. According to the latest stats from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin\u2019s active addresses have contracted by about 1.17 million to 855,000, whereas Ethereum has reduced by about 382,000 to 312,000. This equates to a 27% drawdown for Bitcoin and an 18% decline for Ethereum year-to-date. The absence of new investors entering the market appears to be the primary cause of this decline. This is essential for maintaining favorable momentum, as existing participants dominate trading activity in the absence of new capital inflows. Since early 2024, active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses have been declining \u201cFor the bulls to dominate the market, the influx of new investors is a crucial condition. 1. Bitcoin 1.17M -> 855K\n2. Ethereum 382K -> 312K\u201d \u2013 By @burak_kesmeci Full post \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/gZftQidnxa pic.twitter.com/q5cdpv7x6t \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 1, 2024 The anticipated excitement surrounding the approval of spot ETFs has not translated into increased activity on the blockchain. Still, the current user base carries a lot of investors who would have expected such developments. The continued quantitative tightening of the Federal Reserve continues to strip liquidity from the market, adding more pressure to the situation.  There are, however indications that a potential rebound is near in the face of these challenges. For example, funding rate on Ethereum has remained positive for the past week, meaning there is growing interest among investors in long positions. This implies that whereas plunges in the price of Ethereum have been ongoing, a good majority of the market remains optimistic regarding its performance going forward. BTC and ETH addresses decline: BTC drops to 855K, ETH to 312K in 2024 Since the start of 2024, the number of active Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses has continued to drop. Bitcoin addresses fell from 1.17 million to 855,000, while Ethereum addresses declined from 382,000 to\u2026 \u2014 CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) October 1, 2024 It\u2019s quite interesting that large Ethereum holders have been accumulating their assets, rather than selling them off. These large holders reduced their outflows from 311,950 to 139,390, suggesting they have confidence in the long-term prospects of the altcoin. Investors that do this kind of action usually expect the prices to recover soon. Furthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s Exchange Flow Multiple has experienced a substantial decline. This metric contrasts with short-term inflows and outflows with those over a lengthier period, indicating that current trading activity is significantly lower than historical averages. A low Exchange Flow Multiple typically suggests that investors are holding their assets in anticipation of future price increases rather than actively trading them. The broader bitcoin market is negotiating a complicated terrain molded by geopolitics concerns and legislative changes. Recent occurrences have helped investors to be generally more cautious. For instance, despite market volatility causing Ethereum to tumble to about $2,390, Bitcoin has managed to remain constant above $61,100. Featured image from Vecteezy, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats \u2013 a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill).  Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin\u2019 helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words \u2013 the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

            "content": "Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top altcoins, Solana remains under immense selling pressure. While bulls struggle for momentum, $160 is emerging as a local resistance level for traders to watch out for.  Despite the upside momentum in September, Solana buyers didn\u2019t lift prices above this line. At press time, there is a local double top, even as one analyst on X notes that Solana outperformed other platforms, posting a sharp influx in net inflow. Unlike Ethereum, Solana is a modern blockchain with relatively high scalability. The platform can process thousands of transactions every second, translating to low fees, and thus, more projects are choosing to launch on the network so that user experience remains unaffected. Events over the last three months, looking at the influx of capital to Solana, cement this position. To put in the numbers, Solana registered over $800 million in net flows. This capital injection is more than double what OP Mainnet, an Ethereum layer-2, received\u00a0and way more than what Sui, another scalable blockchain, posted in the last three months. It is also more than what Base and Starknet\u2013two of Ethereum\u2019s popular layer-2s, posted, and exceeds what Avalanche and the BNB Chain received.  Interestingly, during this period, Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 and the largest of them all, Linea, Blast, and Bitcoin saw outflows. Despite being the largest smart contracts platform, Ethereum posted massive outflows of nearly $800 million. It remains to be seen what could have triggered the outflows in Ethereum while encouraging capital to Solana. While on-chain fee differences could be a factor, the continuous dump of ETH in Q3 2024 could have triggered the outflow. At spot rates, ETH is down 35% from Q3 2024 highs, while Solana is just 25% from July highs when it rose to around $192 before pulling back. Even as Solana attracts capital, the coin remains under intense selling pressure. The local line at $160 needs to be convincingly broken for the uptrend seen in the second half of 2023 to continue. Further gains will see Solana float to as high as $190 and possibly break out from the current range. Nonetheless, there could be headwinds. If Bitcoin fails to recover, it could drag the altcoin markets, including Solana, with it. At the same time, there are concerns that the upcoming FTX token distribution would negatively impact SOL prices. Moreover, according to Token Unlocks, the team plans to release tokens on December 26, 2024. Over 66,000 SOL will go out every day for a year.

Dalmas is also the founder of BTC-Pulse, a crypto news site, further demonstrating his commitment to the field. He firmly believes that DeFi and NFTs are here to stay and will continue to drive financial inclusion. Coming from Nairobi, Kenya, it is easy to see the source of his inspiration: Across Africa, millions lack access to traditional banks. Remote villages, limited documentation, and high minimum balances create insurmountable barriers. DeFi, not just Maker or Aave, for example, but think of Bitcoin and USDT, cuts out the middleman. Forget banks with their limitations.\nEven so, DeFi isn't a magic solution. The continent still struggles with reliable internet access, and educational campaigns highlighting the benefits of this wonderful solution are insufficient. Moreover, even for those interested, understanding DeFi can look like learning a new language. Dalmas is here to help make the tech easy to understand and digestible, even for beginners.\nThe story of DeFi in Africa is still being written. Challenges abound, but the promise of a more inclusive financial future is a powerful motivator. With innovation and collaboration, Dalmas firmly believes that DeFi could become the key to unlocking Africa's full economic potential.\nThis possibility and its immense value motivate Dalmas to continue breaking key DeFi innovations and more across the globe.
