            "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a new technology with the potential to completely reshape business practices and create new avenues for innovation. It will significantly impact virtually every industry sector. Organizations have rushed to embrace it, as evidenced by a recent Gallagher survey of 1,000 business owners. In that survey, a vast majority \u2014 81% \u2014 indicated they planned to maintain or increase investments in AI in the near term. However, along with new efficiencies, AI tools will bring new risks to the forefront for those that use them. AI\u2019s risk will force enterprise risk management programs to incorporate strategies to effectively manage, which will undoubtedly be a new process for most entities. Top Risks Associated with Generative AI Use While we\u2019re still evaluating all the risks associated with generative AI, we\u2019ve identified several high-risk categories that bear close attention for business leaders, including: The Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer: A New Role As modern, risk management-oriented organizations leverage AI to remain competitive, they may need to address a new role: The chief artificial intelligence officer (CAIO). The role will require a keen ability to balance innovation with AI risk management, and may include: Where to Start: New AI Risk Management Guidelines Several organizations have recently published suggested frameworks for risk-based standards in implementing AI programs: While not all organizations may be ready for a CAIO at this point, they should carefully consider such an investment. This role will become more important as AI becomes a standard requirement to stay competitive. Most businesses have already embraced AI in some form, and there\u2019s every indication that AI use will continue increasing rapidly. Litigation and regulatory risks have risen in lockstep with the pace of AI engagement, driving the need for risk managers to be at the forefront of AI risk as it unfolds. \nTopics\nInsurTech\nData Driven\nArtificial Intelligence\nRisk Management\n Was this article valuable?

            "content": "Generative AI is rapidly transforming how businesses operate, but many organizations are still in ... [+] the early stages of adoption. In the world of business technology, generative AI has emerged as a transformative force, promising to revolutionize how enterprises operate. Recently, I had the opportunity to discuss the impact of generative AI on the enterprise with Pascal Brier, Chief Innovation Officer and Member of the Group Executive Committee at Capgemini. Our conversation revealed fascinating insights into the current state of generative AI adoption, the challenges businesses face, and the exciting future that lies ahead. Generative AI has quickly become a boardroom priority, with Brier noting that \"about 96 percent of the boardrooms currently have GenAI on the agenda and have one or two sessions being set before the end of the year.\" This heightened interest has translated into a significant increase in adoption rates. According to Capgemini's research, the percentage of large companies that have adopted generative AI has jumped from 6% last year to 24% this year. However, the return on investment (ROI) from these adoptions is still relatively low, ranging from 4% to 7%. Brier suggests that this modest ROI shouldn't be seen as disappointing but rather as a sign that we're still in the early stages of generative AI's potential. \"If we think it's only the beginning, which is what I tend to think, and we're going to get much more than that, then we can say that, yes, there has been some hype, but there is a true thing behind the hype. It's just a matter of time,\" Brier explains. While the potential of generative AI is immense, implementing it effectively comes with its own set of challenges. Brier identifies several key areas that businesses need to focus on to successfully integrate AI into their operations. First and foremost is platform enablement. Organizations need to carefully consider their technology choices and how they'll build their overall AI environment. This isn't just about selecting the right software; it's about creating an ecosystem that can support and scale AI initiatives across the enterprise. Brier emphasizes that this decision is more complex than simply choosing between vendors. Companies must consider factors such as integration capabilities, scalability, and alignment with existing IT infrastructure. Governance is another crucial aspect that companies often discover as they embark on their AI journey. Managing AI models, ensuring security, maintaining ethical standards, and aligning AI use with company culture are all part of this challenge. Brier notes that as AI becomes more integrated into business processes, companies need to establish clear guidelines and oversight mechanisms to manage potential risks and ensure responsible AI use. Identifying the right use cases for AI is also critical for success. Brier suggests three domains of applications for generative AI: Everyday AI (enhancing existing applications), AI in products or services, and AI in the innovation journey. Each of these areas presents unique opportunities and challenges. Companies need to carefully evaluate where AI can add the most value to their operations and strategically prioritize their AI initiatives. Training and skills development emerge as another significant challenge. Preparing the workforce for AI adoption is critical for realizing the technology's full potential. Brier emphasizes the importance of training people not just on technical skills but on how to interact effectively with AI systems, understand security and ethical considerations, and recognize the costs associated with AI use. This holistic approach to AI education helps ensure that employees can work alongside AI systems effectively and responsibly. Finally, responsible use and cost management are crucial considerations. Organizations need to be aware of both the financial and environmental costs of AI implementation. Brier points out that while the current usage might be moderate, as AI scales across the enterprise, these costs will become increasingly significant. Companies need to develop strategies to monitor and manage these costs effectively, balancing the benefits of AI with its resource requirements. Looking ahead, Brier sees several exciting trends shaping the future of AI in the enterprise. One key development is the diversification of AI models. \"We're going to use different types of models,\" Brier predicts. This evolution moves beyond the current focus on selecting a single, all-encompassing model. Instead, organizations will likely employ a mix of large, generic models alongside smaller, specialized models trained for specific needs. This approach allows for greater flexibility and efficiency, tailoring AI capabilities to particular tasks or domains within the enterprise. Another significant trend on the horizon is the emergence of hybrid AI ecosystems. Brier envisions a future where different types of AI work in concert, creating more sophisticated and capable systems. \"Most solutions will use different types of knowledge-based generative AI,\" he explains. This hybrid approach combines the strengths of various AI technologies, potentially including traditional machine learning, natural language processing, and other specialized AI tools. By integrating these diverse AI capabilities, enterprises can create more robust, versatile, and intelligent systems that can tackle complex challenges across various business domains. Perhaps the most intriguing development Brier foresees is the rise of AI agents. \"Everybody will tell you about agents and agentic systems,\" he notes, highlighting the growing buzz around this concept in tech circles. These AI agents represent a significant leap forward in AI functionality and autonomy. At their most basic level, AI agents are specialized software robots trained to perform specific tasks on behalf of users. However, the potential of these agents extends far beyond simple task automation. Brier envisions a progression from single-purpose agents to complex multi-agent systems capable of interacting with each other and making autonomous decisions. This could revolutionize how businesses operate, with AI agents managing everything from supply chains to customer interactions with minimal human intervention. As we stand on the cusp of this AI revolution, it's clear that the impact of generative AI on the enterprise will be profound and far-reaching. While challenges remain, particularly in areas of governance, training, and responsible use, the potential benefits are too significant to ignore. Brier's insights underscore the importance of a thoughtful, strategic approach to AI adoption. As he puts it, \"There is no magic formula... companies have to consider it as one of their five things that they need to look at.\" For business leaders, the message is clear: the time to engage with generative AI is now. By understanding its potential, addressing the challenges head-on, and preparing for the exciting developments on the horizon, enterprises can position themselves to thrive in the AI-powered future that's rapidly unfolding before us.

On Tuesday, Pinterest debuted new ways for advertisers to use generative AI to generate ad creative and automate media buying through its recently unveiled Pinterest Performance+ platform. One new tool lets advertisers turn blank backgrounds into \u201clifestyle imagery\u201d to enhance a brand\u2019s products. Alpha program advertiser Walgreens tested the tool for 50 products \u2014 including a perfume bottle ad that appears to sit on a showroom table \u2014 to drive 55% higher click-through rates. First announced in summer 2024, the feature is now rolling out to more advertisers that want to test new ad formats powered by Pinterest\u2019s generative AI foundation model. By training its model on Pinterest\u2019s visual data set, the company aims to give advertisers ways to create ads that feel native to the platform and personalized for users\u2019 interests and tastes. The updates also build on Pinterest\u2019s multi-year strategy to use AI for improving both user personalization and advertiser performance, said Matt Crystal, Pinterest\u2019s vp of product.\u00a0 \u201cThe ability to say we know [one person] is a mid century modern guy and [another person] is a maximalist is because you\u2019ve expressed that to us via your behavior on the platform,\u201d Crystal told Digiday, describing it as a special sauce of sorts. \u201cThe things you say, the boards you\u2019ve created, etc. For me, that\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting as we think about this personalization vision.\u201d Pinterest\u2019s updates are just the latest in the steady stream of ad-related news from tech giants. In recent months, online platforms have rolled out a number of new advertising features for using AI machine learning and generative AI models. For example, Microsoft this week released new ad tools for Copilot, Bing and Edge. A day later, Google expanded ads for its AI Overviews search summaries.  Naturally, advertisers see the benefits of AI-powered tools for ad creation and automated media-buying. However, some also think a lack of control could be a major obstacle to adoption. Calla Murphy, vp of digital strategy and integrated media at Belardi Wong, said platforms should give advertisers more control over where dollars are going related to customer acquisition, site visits and existing customers. While brands are open to testing ad-creation tools, she\u2019s seeing clients limit tests to feed-based ads like dynamic product ads.\u00a0 \u201cI actually think some of our larger brand clients will probably not be first adopters, because they have that aspect of brand control,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd it will really impact smaller advertisers who maybe will give up brand control for rapid creative generation.\u201d With so many recent updates, here\u2019s a lay-of-the-land with highlights from Pinterest, Microsoft, Google, Meta, TikTok, Snap and Amazon. Pinterest Along with its generative AI updates, Pinterest also officially introduced its automated ad-buying Pinterest Performance+ platform. The company hopes to drive more lower-funnel performance while decreasing campaign creation time and costs. Rather than optimizing bids based on traditional metrics like conversion and clicks, Pinterest will let advertisers optimize bids based on return on ad spend (ROAS). When asked how AI-generated ads perform versus ads created by agencies and brands, Crystal said generative AI helps advertisers scale their ad campaigns based on their product catalogs rather than relying just on humans. \u201cCreating thousands of that former image is really expensive and really time consuming,\u201d he said. \u201cVersus [saying] \u2018I already have a million SKUs in my product catalog, I already have photos of each of these, how can you help me make these assets I already have more engaging?\u2019\u201d Microsoft\u00a0 On Wednesday, Microsoft added more AI tools for advertisers creating ad campaigns while also overhauling how Copilot users will engage with ads within a chatbot conversation. Unveiling a new \u201cstreamlined\u201d ad experience, Microsoft plans to serve ads in a separate section below Copilot\u2019s organic answers, while a new \u201cad voice\u201d feature will aim to make ads feel more natural. Ad targets within a Copilot chat will also be based on an entire conversation rather than only based on the user\u2019s previous prompt. As for advertiser tools, Microsoft introduced new ways for marketers to use Copilot for creating images, videos, banners and text marketing messages. A new \u201cDiagnostics\u201d tool will help advertisers inspect campaigns during set-up before they go live while a new \u201cPerformance Snapshot\u201d tool will help show key insights and trends. Microsoft has also expanded the new AI advertising features beyond Copilot to Bing search and its Edge browser. Meta Meta\u2019s already rolled out features powered by its Llama family of AI models, including tools for image variation, text overlay, image expansion, text generation and background generation. Smaller advertisers have used Meta\u2019s AI for expanding images. Larger advertisers including e-commerce companies have been testing Meta\u2019s ad background generator to help highlight products. Other AI tools have focused on automation in areas like its Advantage+ platform. Although its recent Meta Connect conference didn\u2019t focus on advertising, Meta said at least 1 million advertisers have used various generative AI tools, and that more than 15 million ads were created with generative AI in the past month. Having a lot of assets can help improve AI tools to create on-brand content. However, Meta vp of Product Management Tak Yan said the number of assets an advertiser needs is \u201cquite minimal,\u201d which lets even smaller advertisers leverage what they have. In an interview last month, Yan said the company is working to incorporate brand tone, voice and other brand guidelines beyond existing features for color schemes and text overlay. Meta\u2019s also looking at ways to create ads based on info on a company\u2019s website and expanding tools for video ads and other ad formats. \u201cAnother aspect of this would be how we can put Gen AI and consumer interactivity together,\u201d Yan told Digiday. \u201cThat might include giving consumers control on the experience that they have with ads. And then [with] AI, we can produce interactive, personalized experiences, like with format changes, new affordances for them to control the [ad] creative they ultimately see.\u201d Reddit\u00a0 Over the past few years, Reddit also has acquired several startups \u2014 including MeaningCloud, Spiketrap, Spell, and Oterlu \u2014 to help expand capabilities for its ads manager and other business tools. Another recent acquisition is Memorable, an AI startup that helps advertisers see which creative performs the best on Reddit.\u00a0\u00a0 Along with building tools to help advertisers automate bidding, Reddit has rolled out AI tools to help forecasting, improved keyword targeting and other campaign analysis features. Another AI tool helps advertisers generate headlines when marketing the same product to various audiences. Other tools include prompt templates to help them find the right audiences using generative AI, gauge a brand\u2019s share of voice, and understand brand sentiment across the platform. \u201cMaybe you and I are both interested in a credit card,\u201d posed Roelof van Zwol, Reddit\u2019s vp of ads engineering, in a Digiday interview last month. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re looking because you want to get extra points or benefits in another way, like the concierge services. And I might be looking at it because I\u2019m not willing to pay any fees.

            "content": "Humans are able to sleep-on-it and make better decisions, so what about generative AI? In today\u2019s column, I examine a longstanding expression that we all have undoubtedly used from time to time, namely that when making a decision sometimes you say that you will sleep on it. The semblance of this common remark is that you want more time to think about the decision that needs to be made. Humans say this quite frequently. Does the same remark of aiming to sleep-on-it apply to generative AI? I say yes, it does. This analysis of an intriguing proposition is part of my ongoing Forbes.com column coverage on the latest in AI including identifying and explaining various AI complexities (see the link here). Some background about the human meaning of sleep-on-it will help set the stage for bringing AI into the picture. In a research article entitled \u201cThink, Blink Or Sleep On It? The Impact Of Modes Of Thought On Complex Decision Making\u201d by Ben Newell, Kwan Yao Wong, Jeremy Cheung, and Tim Rakow, Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, April 2009, these key points were made (excerpts): The core of the matter is that by saying you want to sleep on it, you do so in lieu of making a snap judgment. You want more time to mull over your options. By someone saying that they need to sleep on a weighty consideration, it gives them a kind of polite or deft sidestep of not having to instantly render a decision. Sometimes this is acknowledged and agreed to. They are granted a reprieve. In other cases, such as a pressing in-the-moment circumstance, they aren\u2019t allowed more time and must decide on the spot or in the blink of an eye. Thus, one notable element is that the sleep-on-it proclamation buys you added time to decide. There is another facet that we need to ponder. Do you really need to sleep on the matter at hand? In other words, if you say that you will sleep on it, in one sense this is just saying that you want a day or so to figure things out. It doesn\u2019t necessarily require that you are only going to mentally determine things because of sleeping. The sleeping contrivance is merely a quick way to convey that you want more time, such as overnight, and will have a response the next day. Controversy Over The Sleep Element Sticklers might insist that if you say you will sleep on it, you must indeed make your decision while being asleep. You put your head on your pillow, fall into slumber, and voila, you wake up with your decision. This seems a bit silly as a stipulation and altogether questionable. I\u2019d dare suggest that much of the time we generally accept that you aren\u2019t truly going to decide while asleep. Again, the utterance is more so about gaining time to decide. In any case, much research has been undertaken about what seems to happen while you are essentially unconsciously thinking while in the act of sleeping. I say unconsciously due to the fact that when asleep you don\u2019t seem to be conscious in the normal way we think of things. You aren\u2019t knocked out per se, nor are you likely abundantly aware of your surroundings. In recap, sleep-on-it consists of: Bringing AI Into The Big Picture What does sleep-on-it mean in an AI context? I\u2019ll share my thoughts on this but first want to engage you in something that spurred my resolve to write about the matter. There is a great deal of postulation about what AI is or isn\u2019t, and what AI can and cannot do, oftentimes stated by AI experts and via non-AI experts too. I\u2019ve been extensively covering the role of generative AI in the medical and healthcare sectors, especially in the realm of AI and mental health (see my comprehensive analysis at the link here). Sometimes, I witness remarks about AI that stir me to provide vital commentary. Here's what got my eyebrows raised. A write-up about a medical doctor who after seeing a patient was later the next day able to make further effort because of sleeping on the matter, brought up that AI could presumably not do anything of a similar kind. Ergo, we are led to believe that AI as we know it even today is portrayed as categorically inferior. The topic came up in a recent article on medical decision-making entitled \u201cEchoes of Concern: AI and Moral Agency in Medicine\u201d by Sarah Hull and Joseph J. Fins, JAMA Cardiology, September 2, 2024, which made these points (excerpts): The crux is that oftentimes I hear or read that AI lacks a sense of moral agency and therefore we are to seemingly condemn AI or assume that AI cannot do this or that. Let\u2019s get this cleared up. Laying The Facts Straight Out The circumstance of a human mentally percolating on something and coming up with additional ideas or a sense of resolve can arise after a sleep-on-it, as I\u2019ve above noted. This might entail the sleep part or might just be that extra time has been utilized to do deeper thinking. In a manner of speaking, we can certainly do likewise with AI. For example, I\u2019ve recently covered that the latest ChatGPT generative AI by OpenAI known as o1 can potentially arrive at improved answers partially due to an added approach referred to as chain-of-thought processing (see the link here). The chain-of-thought approach forces the AI to take more computational cycles, working stepwise on a systematic basis, and calculate answers to a more extensive degree. You need to wait a bit longer to get a reply, but hopefully, the wait is worth the benefit of better responses. I liken this to playing chess. If you are time-pressured and must make split-second chess moves, the amount of mental exploration is highly limited. Playing at a measured pace allows you to examine many more moves and try to look ahead at what might happen on the chessboard. AI-based chess-playing systems face a similar conundrum, namely if less time is available, the search space must be narrowed, while if time is aplenty, the search space can be more extensively assessed. My point is that with generative AI, we can readily tell the AI to take more time and computationally explore further than it might otherwise have done. This can be set up to automatically take place. In essence, you can simply grant that more time is always allowed, and henceforth the AI will consume additional computational cycles at your behest to find a deeper answer (of course, this is likely to cost you something extra if paying for the computational usage, but that\u2019s a story for another day). Example Using ChatGPT To Sleep On It Go with me that we are setting aside the sleeping aspects and focusing on the idea of getting more time to make a decision. I logged into the widely popular ChatGPT and decided to see if the generative AI could help me come up with a marketing tagline. Here\u2019s the dialogue: I then logged out. The next day, I logged back in. As you can see, the additional computational time appeared to get an improved response. One aside that I feel compelled to mention. I abhor the wording of most generative AI responses that say things ostensibly anthropomorphizing the AI. This is unnecessary and egregiously misleading. I\u2019ve repeatedly noted that the AI makers can easily change the wording that comes out of generative AI to not mislead in this fashion (see my discussion at the link here). Back to the matter at hand. You might quibble whether the proposed taglines were that much better than the initial set, but my emphasis is that the AI was granted additional time to work up a response. Sometimes the response might be improved, but admittedly, other times the improvement might seem marginal or minimal. That\u2019s the way the ball bounces. Benjamin Franklin Knew To Sleep On It A few final thoughts. An AI-powered system, even one in a medical context, can be established to make one-time instantaneous responses or be set up to provide both immediate and longer-term answers. You can tell the AI to give an instant answer because you want the quickest response right away. Plus, you can tell the AI to consume more computational cycles, work let\u2019s say overnight, and take a deeper exploration, akin to the chess playing that I mentioned before. This brings up a slew of complex AI ethical questions and AI legal questions. Suppose that a vendor providing AI has opted to short-cut the computationally allowed processing time. The AI spits out an answer. The answer is a roughly calculated one. Had the AI been given a nudge to process more deeply, perhaps a different or better answer might have been found. What are the proper limits for this kind of setup? If life-or-death decisions are at stake, you can undoubtedly discern how important these design and fielding decisions are. I want to clarify too that I am not suggesting that today\u2019s AI has any semblance of moral agency. Modern AI is not sentient. We seem to be heading toward artificial general intelligence or AGI, which if we get there, will indubitably change our perspective on AI moral considerations (see my discussions at the link here and the link here, for example). We aren\u2019t there yet. Generative AI is a means of mimicking human writing. The AI has been computationally data trained on human written works found on the Internet. When you interact with generative AI, it is essentially parroting somewhat the patterns found in how humans express themselves. I mention this because we can do a similar form of mimicry about the human sleep-on-it phenomenon. AI can be readily guided to expend additional computational cycles to seek a deeper or better response. This is not an AI-self-based moral choice; it is a choice by the humans who are making the AI and/or making use of the AI. One last comment. There are tradeoffs in the way that humans do things and the way that AI does things. The idea that a human might do a sleep-on-it, well, that\u2019s a pretty much idiosyncratic aspect. Sometimes a doctor might sleep on it, but other times they might decide that their first decision was sound and there isn\u2019t any need to give it further thought (despite the possibility that their initial judgment could be amplified if they did a sleep on it). Or they might be so overwhelmed with patient cases and simply not have the mental bandwidth to sleep on it, certainly not with all the myriad of cases and each day of seeing patients. For an AI system, you can essentially guarantee a sleep-on-it will occur, if that\u2019s what you want to do (and can afford to do so). All cases and all patients. Each and every day. No exceptions. This would be an ironclad proposition. I\u2019m not saying that this makes AI better than humans. Nope. So please don\u2019t troll me. I am noting that humans involve a great deal of variability, though we do get the human mind at play. AI of today is not on par with the human mind, but we can get a form of consistency and extensiveness from automation if willing to do so. In situations of both humans and AI working together, we can possibly get the best of both worlds. A human doctor that sometimes does a sleep-on-it, coupled with an AI-based system that always sleeps on it, propelling the two to work hand-in-hand toward providing the highest possible quality of care. An aspirational goal. Let\u2019s go to the last word for now. As famed Benjamin Franklin in 1772 noted about a somewhat sleep on it regimen: True words then, still true words today.  One Community.

To celebrate the unofficial yet widely-embraced start of the festive period, Manila-based cafe and coffee roaster Commune teamed up with Google Philippines on a limited edition Bibingka Latte. Drawing inspiration from a traditional Filipino Christmas delicacy, the espresso and steamed milk drink is topped with shredded\u00a0queso de bola and salted egg, and decorated with a torched banana leaf. Bibingka Latte was created using Gemini, Google's generative AI model. Gemini drafted various drink concepts, which Commune's baristas then refined. Google also trained Commune staff on AI applications to help them craft innovative new beverages. Aside from serving as a reminder that the end of another year is fast approaching, the collaboration highlights three takeaways for brands to consider. First, cultural micro-moments, like the start of the 'ber' months in the Philippines, are important organic milestones. More localized and bottom-up than the standard holidays marketers are accustomed to activating, they resonate deeply with consumers. How might your brand engage with cultural micro-moments that matter to your audience? Secondly, using generative AI to spark new ideas that workers can run with demonstrates the power of combining artificial intelligence and human creativity \u2014 and the resulting real-world products make AI's\u00a0potential tangible to consumers. Finally, Google and Commune's partnership underscores the importance of working with diverse entities to explore how new technologies can benefit to society. The combination of generative AI, Filipino coffee and festive treats might not have been on your 2024 trend bingo card, but it's time to consider which communities your brand can collaborate with to push innovation boundaries.

As AI technologies continue to mature, they are enabling new forms of work, creating opportunities for individuals seeking greater flexibility and autonomy. Many younger adults are turning to platforms like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to earn extra income on their own terms. This trend is not limited to these jobs; white collar professionals are also embracing the gig economy through platforms like Toptal, Fiverr and Upwork, seeking greater flexibility and the ability to work on projects that align with their passions. the gig economy is transforming with both low and high paid gig work.

(Photo by EyesWideOpen/Getty Images) The growth of the gig economy has led to a surge in the popularity of the \"digital nomad\" lifestyle. This trend is particularly appealing to highly educated individuals who seek greater flexibility and the ability to work remotely. Automation and AI platforms have played a crucial role in enabling this lifestyle by providing the tools and payment infrastructure necessary for remote work. For example, AI-powered collaboration tools and cloud-based software have made it easier for digital nomads to connect with clients and colleagues, regardless of their location. Additionally, AI-powered translation and communication tools have broken down language barriers, allowing digital nomads to work with clients from around the world. These systems have simplified payment and opened up a much larger employee and employment catchment area beyond the traditional hubs. Demographics of Gig Workers: Millennials and Generation Z are particularly likely to embrace gig work due to their preference for flexibility and their comfort with technology. Parents often choose gig work to balance their childcare responsibilities with their careers. Students may turn to gig work to earn extra income or gain experience in their field. Many retired individuals choose gig work as a way to stay active and earn supplemental income.

BROWN / AFP) (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) The AI gig economy's growth presents both opportunities and challenges for the larger economy. On the one hand, it can create new jobs, flexibility and stimulate economic growth. On the other hand, it can also lead to increased income inequality, job insecurity and a race to the bottom. Notably, in the AI-driven gig economy, gig workers often find themselves working not directly for clients but through AI agent intermediaries. These AI agents assign tasks, facilitate payment, and dispatch work, creating a new dynamic in the labor market that requires careful consideration and regulation. To ensure that the gig economy benefits all segments of society, policymakers must address issues such as worker classification, benefits, and labor protections. By establishing clear guidelines for AI deployment, governments can help to mitigate potential risks such as algorithmic bias, privacy violations, and job displacement. These guidelines should address issues like transparency in AI decision-making, data privacy protections, and safeguards against discriminatory outcomes. Additionally, ensuring worker protections is crucial to prevent exploitation and maintain a fair working environment. The gig economy is undergoing a rapid transformation, driven in part by the advancement of AI. As AI technologies continue to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative forms of work emerging. By understanding the trends and challenges associated with the gig economy, individuals and businesses can better position themselves to thrive in this new era of work.  One Community.

            "content": "John Mulaney, photo by: Kyle Dubiel OpenAI just landed the biggest venture capital round of all time, $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, making the ChatGPT-maker one of the largest startups in the world, next to TikTok\u2019s ByteDance and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. For extra liquidity, it also secured a $4 billion line of credit from a consortium of leading banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. But is $10.6 billion enough in its quest to advance reasoning and make autonomous agents mainstream in 2025? How much cash is going to be needed and are these costs even sustainable? OpenAI has yet to turn a profit. On $3.7 billion in revenue for 2024, the company expects to lose $5 billion, a source told CNBC. It currently has 11 million ChatGPT+ paid subscribers, one million ChatGPT Enterprise paid subscribers and is projecting revenue of $11.6 billion for next year. Thrive Capital, which led its most recent round, has already pledged an additional billion dollars for 2025. Some of tech\u2019s deepest pockets are in the current mix of investors including Nvidia, Microsoft, SoftBank, Tiger Global, Khosla Ventures, Fidelity, ARK Venture Fund, Altimeter Capital Management and MGX backed by UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, according to the Wall Street Journal. But if the company doesn\u2019t restructure to a for-profit venture within two years, funding can convert to debt, reported the New York Times. With the release of Advanced Voice, ChatGPT has transformed into a highly entertaining hands-free assistant akin to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s operating system character in the movie Her, and offers engaging multimodal features like voice-to-image that allows for imaginative storytelling, coaching and companionship. Available to a small beta group right now, session times and related costs are likely to skyrocket once the feature is available for its 250 million users. More so, once connected to the internet. Right now, knowledge cutoff is end of last year. At a press pre-briefing for OpenAI Dev Day, the company said driving down costs remains a top focus and it\u2019s been able to cut API costs by 99% over the past two years for its developer community, which now stands at three million. More than a trillion dollars is expected to be spent on AI over the next five years, according to Goldman Sachs. However, Fortune 500 companies vary widely in where they are in their digital transformation journey. Disney, Wyndham, OpenTable, Wiley and Saks have been piloting Salesforce\u2019s advanced reasoning engine, Atlas, to create agents that optimize the consumer experience\u2014whether it\u2019s helping Disneyland tour guides get real-time ride availability to reduce visitor wait times or enabling the Saks AI Shopping Concierge to transact and ship outfits on behalf of customers via text, voice and image prompts. Priceline has been using OpenAI\u2019s Realtime API for Advanced Voice to create an AI agent named Penny Voice that can provide hands-free search and bookings for hotels as well as recommendations for restaurants and activities. CEO Brett Keller told me the goal for Penny is to become a full-service concierge. \u201cWe are working on exciting enhancements to Penny, to give more insight into the on-the-ground neighborhood feel,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's the softer stuff travel websites haven't been as good at helping customers understand and that's place we're leaning into with Penny so people can feel confident in what they're looking to book.\u201d United Airlines has found one of the most compelling use cases for agents to assist with migrating legacy mainframe systems written in COBOL, a 60 year old programming language that few know. CIO Jason Birnbaum explained, \u201cUsing generative AI to unlock that code is a powerful thing for us as we transition it into the modern cloud environment.\u201d As enterprise figures out best moves with the technology, Gartner is predicting that 30% of AI projects will be abandoned by the end of 2025. And immense cost and complexity of deployment are only part of the problem. \u201cThe biggest challenge is not so much the implementation of the model, but getting the data ready, which needs to be clean and accessible,\u201d Deloitte CTO Bill Briggs told me, explaining the firm\u2019s data modernization business has been red hot. \u201cNo CEO wants to take on a nine-figure project to replace the plumbing,\u201d he said, it\u2019s best if they\u2019ve been making the investment all along. To help businesses of all sizes, template-driven low code agent builders have been popping up, like those from Salesforce and HubSpot, as a way to speed to market. At Salesforce\u2019s annual conference, Dreamforce, in San Francisco last month, music producer and Black Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.am demoed for me how he\u2019s been using Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce platform to enable listeners of his RAiDiO.FYI app to order merchandise from ads, with voice. \u201cSo think about radio right now. You get into a car, you listen to music, and you want that item on the commercial. All you need to do is ask for it,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we've added this commerce feature on the back end, now you can transact. The moment you want to make a purchase and add it to a cart, it transfers to Agentforce.\u201d It was also at Dreamforce that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the challenges facing humanity as \u201cmany and worthy\u201d to be tackled right away. He presented a vision of billions of agents helping humans do all sorts of things, some specialized, some generalized, understanding subtleties, reasoning with itself while reflecting on answers and collaborating with others. \u201cWork is going to be done before we even think of it,\u201d he laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to come to work and a whole bunch of things we didn\u2019t realize needed to be done will be done.\u201d \u201cNobody should miss the next decade,\u201d he added. But comedian John Mulaney, who closed the show, had the last laugh. \u201cBackstage I heard someone say we need to skill up the human\u2014felt like I was in a movie with some terrifying sh*t about to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wish what you're doing won't work, but I'm sure it will.\u201d Updated October 4 with OpenAI Dev Day press briefing details, copy edits, and quotes from Will.i.am and United CIO Jason Birnbaum.

In August, Google announced Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B, a new experimental AI model that further reduces costs by using only 8 billion parameters. After testing it with developers over the past few weeks, Google today announced the production-ready release of Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B, which can be used for high-volume multimodal use cases, long-context summarization tasks, and more. Compared to the original 1.5 Flash, the new 1.5 Flash 8B model costs 50% less, offers 2x higher rate limits, and comes with lower latency on small prompts. In terms of performance, 1.5 Flash 8B nearly matches the performance of the 1.5 Flash model launched in May. It is particularly well-suited for tasks such as chat, transcription, and long-context language translation. A comparison of the new model's benchmarks is available below.  The main highlight of this new 8B model is its cost. Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B is the cheapest AI model from Google to date. You can find the full pricing below: To support high-volume AI applications, Google is also increasing the rate limit for this new model. Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B now supports 4,000 requests per minute (RPM), which is double the previous limit. Interested developers can now try out the new gemini-1.5-flash-8b model for free via Google AI Studio and the Gemini API. For paid-tier developers, billing for this new model starts on Monday, October 14th. With its impressive combination of performance, affordability, and accessibility, Google's new Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B model is poised to become a popular AI model choice for developers across various domains.

            "content": "Credit: AFP At Meta Connect 2024, Meta unveiled its new Orion AR glasses and the latest Ray-Ban smart glasses, showcasing innovative technologies. The company emphasized that Apple's Vision Pro may be heading in the wrong direction. Bloomberg tech analyst Mark Gurman noted Apple's realization that its headset design needs reconsideration, though no consensus has been reached internally. Meanwhile, Meta's AR glasses development appears to be progressing faster than Apple\u2019s lab efforts. Apple evaluates 5 potential product roadmaps for Vision Pro development Apple is evaluating five potential development paths for Vision Pro, according to Gurman. These include maintaining the current direction, developing a smart display, creating smart glasses, integrating AI with AirPods, and launching standalone AR glasses. This assessment reflects Apple's broader efforts to optimize the Vision Pro for diverse markets. The \"maintain the current strategy\" approach involves continuing the current Vision Pro development while releasing a more budget-friendly version. This could be achieved through using cheaper materials, simplified internal components, and lower-resolution displays, helping to reduce production costs. The \"smart display\" approach suggests removing the Vision Pro's internal computer and external battery, and transferring these functions to the iPhone. This would reduce the Vision Pro's weight and heat output while lowering production costs, potentially resulting in a more affordable price. The \"smart glasses\" approach involves Apple exploring glasses similar to Meta's Ray-Ban model, without AR capabilities. Leveraging its expertise in chips, audio, and AI, Apple aims to design an appealing and innovative smart glasses device. The \"AI and AirPods\" approach involves Apple working on a new AirPods Pro model featuring external cameras and AI to understand the environment and provide user feedback. While similar to a smart glasses concept, this product doesn\u2019t include an actual glasses design. The ultimate approach envisions a standalone AR device with high-performance lenses, a built-in computer, a battery system, cameras, and eye-tracking technology, all within a regular glasses form factor. Gurman noted this has been a longtime dream of CEO Tim Cook, though development faced earlier challenges. Price, concept, and product positioning: Still lacking consumer appeal The Vision Pro faces significant challenges, serving more as a tech showcase than a mainstream consumer product. Consumers don't see a compelling need to buy it, with issues like discomfort during long wear, limited third-party apps, and lack of standout features. Whether marketed as a mixed reality (MR) or spatial computing device, the Vision Pro has yet to resonate with consumers. Gurman also argues that the Vision Pro's US$3,500 price tag is too high compared to Meta's products. Even with a US$500 or US$1,000 reduction, it's unlikely to drive significant sales, as it would lead to reduced profits for only a slight increase in market share. The Vision Pro costs more than 10 times the price of Meta's entry-level Quest products, with the Quest 3S starting at just US$299. This makes Meta better positioned to mainstream MR. The Quest 3S, priced for gifting or immersive movie and gaming experiences, is far more accessible than Apple's Vision Pro. At Meta Connect 2024, the new Ray-Ban smart glasses captured consumer interest with their sleek design, practical features, and Meta's effective marketing. Interestingly, this success comes in an area where Apple has traditionally thrived. Some suggest that these Ray-Ban smart glasses could have been an Apple product.eeeeeeee  ...",

            "content": "Election 2024 coverage presented by Aptos (APT), the Layer 1 blockchain inspired by the discontinued Diem (formerly Libra) blockchain developed by Meta, has become the latest network where investors can trade shares of Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX). The fund, which is the second-largest tokenized fund on the market with a $435 million market cap, is already available on Ethereum via Arbitrum, Stellar and Polygon as well as Avalanche. Franklin\u2019s latest addition is due to Aptos\u2019 unique characteristics which also meet the asset manager\u2019s rigorous suitability standards for its Benji platform, the firm\u2019s blockchain-integrated recordkeeping system, said Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton. One Benji token represents one share of the fund. Aptos is a fairly young Layer 1 blockchain launched in 2022. It employs the Move programming language, which it claims allows for faster and more protected transactions. Aptos Labs, the developers behind the blockchain, have long made it their mission to bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and large, traditional institutions, as have other Layer 1 blockchains. In April, the firm started partnering with Microsoft and Brevan Howard, as well as South Korean telecommunications operator SK Telecom to help institutions make it easier to experiment in decentralized finance. \u201cFranklin Templeton\u2019s willingness to innovate in the name of a truly decentralized and accessible financial future is inspiring,\u201d said Bashar Lazaar, Head of Grants and Ecosystem at Aptos Foundation. \u201cTo reach that future, we need to connect not just the TradFi and DeFi worlds, but EVM and non-EVM networks as well. Integrating the Benji Investments platform with the Aptos Network is a massive step in the right direction and we look forward to welcoming them to the Aptos ecosystem,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Blockchain currency has emerged as a transformative force in the global financial landscape. While its primary function as a decentralized digital asset has garnered attention, its potential to address economic inequality is equally noteworthy. By offering an alternative to traditional banking systems and promoting financial inclusion, blockchain currency is gradually leveling the economic playing field. This article explores how blockchain currency can reduce economic inequality and create opportunities for underserved communities worldwide. \u00a0 Empowering the Unbanked \u00a0 Financial Access for All \u00a0 One of the most significant challenges in addressing economic inequality is the lack of access to financial services. According to the World Bank, nearly 1.7 billion adults worldwide are unbanked, meaning they do not have access to a bank account or any formal financial institution. This exclusion often perpetuates poverty, as individuals without access to banking services struggle to save money, obtain credit, or engage in economic activities. Blockchain currency provides a viable solution by enabling financial transactions without the need for traditional banks. With just a smartphone and internet connection, individuals can create a digital wallet, store assets, and make transactions. This accessibility is particularly beneficial in developing regions where banking infrastructure is limited or non-existent. You can also explore Eclipse Earn for further information. \u00a0 Lower Transaction Costs \u00a0 Traditional financial systems often burden users with high transaction fees, particularly for cross-border payments. These fees can be prohibitive for low-income individuals and small businesses, further exacerbating economic inequality. Blockchain technology, however, facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, significantly reducing transaction costs. \u00a0 Lower fees mean that more of the money sent by migrant workers, for instance, reaches their families back home. This not only improves the financial well-being of recipients but also stimulates local economies, contributing to a reduction in poverty levels. \u00a0 Promoting Economic Inclusion \u00a0 Democratizing Investment Opportunities \u00a0 Investment opportunities have historically been reserved for the wealthy, with high entry barriers preventing lower-income individuals from participating in wealth-building activities. Blockchain currency is changing this dynamic by democratizing access to investment platforms. Through tokenization, assets such as real estate, art, or commodities can be divided into smaller units and traded on blockchain platforms. This allows individuals with limited capital to invest in assets they would otherwise be unable to afford. By lowering the barriers to entry, blockchain currency enables a broader segment of the population to participate in wealth creation, thereby narrowing the wealth gap and promoting economic inclusion. \u00a0 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Solutions \u00a0 Decentralized finance (DeFi) is another area where blockchain technology is making a significant impact on economic inequality. DeFi platforms offer financial services such as lending, borrowing, and earning interest, all without the need for traditional banks. These platforms operate on blockchain networks, ensuring transparency, security, and accessibility. \u00a0 For individuals in countries with unstable or corrupt financial systems, DeFi provides an alternative means of accessing financial services. Users can engage in lending and borrowing activities, earn interest on their assets, and even take out loans without the need for a credit check. This empowers individuals who have been excluded from traditional financial systems due to lack of credit history or other barriers. \u00a0 Enhancing Transparency and Reducing Corruption \u00a0 Transparent Transactions \u00a0 Corruption is a major contributor to economic inequality, particularly in developing countries where funds meant for public services are often siphoned off by corrupt officials. Blockchain technology's inherent transparency offers a solution to this problem. Every transaction made on a blockchain is recorded on a public ledger, which is immutable and accessible to anyone. This transparency reduces the likelihood of funds being misappropriated and ensures that financial resources reach their intended recipients. For example, governments can use blockchain technology to distribute social welfare benefits, ensuring that funds are delivered directly to the intended beneficiaries without any intermediaries. This can help reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations. \u00a0 Reducing Barriers to Entry for Entrepreneurs \u00a0 Entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic growth and job creation, yet many aspiring entrepreneurs face significant barriers to entry, including lack of access to capital and bureaucratic red tape. Blockchain technology can help remove these barriers by providing a platform for fundraising and business development. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Security Token Offerings (STOs) are examples of how blockchain technology is revolutionizing fundraising for startups. These methods allow entrepreneurs to raise capital from a global pool of investors without the need for traditional venture capital firms or banks. By reducing reliance on traditional financial institutions, blockchain currency empowers entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds to launch and grow their businesses, contributing to economic growth and job creation. \u00a0 Conclusion \u00a0 The role of blockchain currency in reducing economic inequality cannot be overstated. By providing financial access to the unbanked, lowering transaction costs, democratizing investment opportunities, and enhancing transparency, blockchain technology is creating a more inclusive global economy. As adoption of this technology continues to grow, it has the potential to significantly narrow the wealth gap and promote economic equality on a global scale. The transformative power of blockchain currency lies in its ability to empower individuals, particularly those who have been historically marginalized, to participate in the global economy and improve their economic well-being. \u00a0 How to comment \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don't insult other visitors.

            "content": "In recent years, the integrity of electoral processes has been a subject of intense scrutiny. As digital technology increasingly influences various aspects of our lives, it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s also reshaping how we approach elections. Among the technological advancements, blockchain technology stands out as a promising solution to enhance transparency, security, and trust in electoral systems. This article explores how blockchain can transform elections by ensuring transparency and integrity, thereby restoring public confidence in the democratic process. \u00a0 Understanding Blockchain Technology \u00a0 Why Blockchain is Relevant to Elections \u00a0 The relevance of blockchain to elections lies in its ability to provide a secure and transparent method of recording votes. Traditional voting systems, whether paper-based or electronic, are susceptible to various forms of tampering, fraud, and human error. Blockchain technology, however, can address these issues by offering a system that is tamper-resistant, transparent, and verifiable by all stakeholders. \u00a0 How Blockchain Enhances Election Transparency \u00a0 Securing the Voting Process \u00a0 One of the main advantages of blockchain technology in elections is its ability to secure the voting process. Since each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, it is nearly impossible for malicious actors to alter or delete votes without being detected. This ensures that the outcome of the election accurately reflects the will of the voters, free from external manipulation. You can also explore wealth catalyst ai for further information. \u00a0 Ensuring Transparency \u00a0 Transparency is another critical aspect of fair elections, and blockchain excels in this area. With blockchain, each vote is recorded on a public ledger that can be audited by anyone with access. This means that voters, election officials, and even independent observers can verify that the votes have been counted correctly. This level of transparency can significantly reduce the chances of electoral fraud and increase trust in the electoral process. \u00a0 Enhancing Voter Confidence \u00a0 When voters are confident that their votes will be accurately counted and that the election process is transparent, they are more likely to participate in elections. Blockchain technology can enhance voter confidence by providing a clear, unalterable record of each vote. This assurance can lead to higher voter turnout and a more robust democratic process. \u00a0 Potential Challenges and Solutions \u00a0 Technical Challenges \u00a0 While blockchain holds great promise for enhancing transparency in elections, it is not without its challenges. One of the primary technical challenges is the scalability of blockchain networks. Elections involve millions of votes, and the blockchain must be able to handle this volume without slowing down or crashing. \u00a0 Addressing Scalability \u00a0 To address scalability concerns, some experts suggest using a hybrid approach that combines blockchain with traditional databases. In this model, the blockchain would handle the most critical parts of the election process, such as recording and verifying votes, while less critical data could be stored on traditional databases. This approach could help balance the need for transparency with the technical limitations of blockchain technology. \u00a0 Regulatory and Legal Challenges \u00a0 Another significant challenge is the regulatory and legal framework surrounding the use of blockchain in elections. Many countries have strict regulations regarding how elections are conducted, and integrating a new technology like blockchain would require changes to existing laws and regulations. \u00a0 Navigating Legal Frameworks \u00a0 To overcome these challenges, governments and regulatory bodies must work closely with blockchain experts to develop a legal framework that supports the use of blockchain in elections. This framework should address issues such as data privacy, voter anonymity, and the legality of blockchain-based voting systems. By creating a supportive legal environment, countries can more easily adopt blockchain technology in their electoral processes. \u00a0 Real-World Applications and Success Stories \u00a0 Estonia's E-Voting System \u00a0 Estonia is one of the few countries that have successfully integrated blockchain into its voting system. The country\u2019s e-voting system, which has been in use since 2005, relies on blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and transparency of the voting process. Estonia\u2019s success demonstrates that blockchain can be effectively used in national elections, providing a model for other countries to follow. \u00a0 Other Pilot Projects \u00a0 Several other countries, including the United States, Switzerland, and South Korea, have conducted pilot projects to test the feasibility of using blockchain in elections. These projects have shown promising results, indicating that blockchain could play a significant role in future elections worldwide. \u00a0 Conclusion \u00a0 Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way elections are conducted by enhancing transparency, security, and voter confidence. While there are challenges to be addressed, the benefits of using blockchain in elections are clear. As more countries explore and adopt this technology, we can expect to see a significant shift towards more transparent and trustworthy electoral processes. The future of democracy may very well depend on how effectively we can integrate blockchain into our voting systems, ensuring that every vote is counted and every voice is heard. \u00a0 How to comment \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don't insult other visitors.

Last month the Indian government launched the Vishvasya-Blockchain Technology Stack, that would offer blockchain-as-a-service, the intention being to make governance more transparent, efficient, and accountable.  The government\u2019s initiative will simplify the integration of blockchain technology into various applications, says Sharat Chandra, a blockchain and emerging tech evangelist.  Instances of data breaches and personal information of citizens floating around in the dark web is worrying for people. \u201cWhile Aadhaar provides identity verification, Vishvasya can ensure that the data associated with those identities is immutable and tamper-proof,\u201d Chandra told businessline in an email interview, where he spoke about CBDCs leveraging blockchain tech, the potential of tokenisation in industry and distributed ledger technologies.  Chandra is working with a few state government-affiliated entities on establishing token standards for land records, with the goal of facilitating seamless transfers of land ownership and Transfer of Development Rights. He was also involved in shaping the National Strategy on Blockchain by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) in 2021. The Vishvasya stack is designed as a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform, which means it simplifies the integration of blockchain technology into various applications for state governments such as Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Bihar and Karnataka which have blockchain projects underway and are leading in blockchain adoption. By complementing existing frameworks like Aadhaar and Digilocker, Vishvasya enhances security, transparency, and efficiency in public service delivery. For instance, while Aadhaar provides identity verification, Vishvasya can ensure that the data associated with those identities is immutable and tamper-proof. This synergy allows for a more robust digital infrastructure where services can be delivered securely and efficiently across sectors like healthcare, education, and governance. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are poised to significantly benefit from blockchain technology. By leveraging programmability, quantum resistant cryptography and on-chain settlement, CBDCs can enhance transaction speed and security, especially for cross-border payments. Blockchain allows for real-time settlement of transactions, which can drastically reduce costs associated with traditional systems like SWIFT. While it\u2019s highly unlikely that CBDCs will completely replace SWIFT in the immediate future, they could serve as a complementary system that offers faster and more transparent transactions globally. Tokenisation has immense potential across various industries, but I believe real estate and financial assets such as bonds, money market funds, private equity and government securities are likely to lead the charge. These sectors have traditionally faced liquidity challenges, and tokenisation can democratise access by allowing fractional ownership. However, regulatory frameworks are crucial here. While we\u2019re making progress, ongoing dialogue between regulators and industry stakeholders will be key to navigating this evolving landscape. In the long term, I see Distributed Ledger Technologies becoming integral to our financial market infrastructure in several ways. Full scale adoption of tokenisation and DLT markets are still a couple of years away. A lot of groundwork needs to happen in terms of building interoperability standards and consensus on regulation of digital assets. Smart contracts can automate processes in trade finance and supply chain management, reducing delays and increasing trust among parties involved. Indian Banks\u2019 Digital Infrastructure Company, a consortium of 18 banks , is currently working on tokenisation and smart contract-based deep-tier financing for MSMEs as part of RBI\u2019s regulatory sandbox. These initiatives will aid in blockchain adoption in the banking and financial services sector. As more industries recognise these efficiencies, I expect a broader adoption of blockchain solutions across sectors such as sustainable finance and blockchain based trading of carbon credits, especially under the aegis of GIFT - IFSCA. \nComments\n BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

            "content": "Pekao Bank from Poland, the country\u2019s second largest lender, is making headlines by taking a bold approach to preserving art. Using the medium of blockchain technology, it has kept some of its most valuable artworks in an Arctic vault, and less exposed to the elements. This is just one of the latest developments from a growing practice: slowly but surely, more and more institutions are coming to realize that protecting cultural heritage against environmental damage and degradation is long overdue. Therefore, Pekao Bank created digital representations of art with a focus on being able to withstand the environmental catastrophes of climate change for longer periods of time. Blockchain technology is set to revolutionize the mindset of owning and preserving art. In contrast to physical measures, an artifact would always be at the mercy of decay and damage, which has marred museums and collectors in the past. But with NFTs and digital forms of representation, the artworks can be tokenized and safely placed on blockchain networks. This does not only preserve the piece but also goes out to create a transparent and immutable record of ownership and provenance. Under modern 3D scanning technology, Bank Pekao is digitizing well-known Polish artworks including those by Jan Matejko and Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski for this project. Then kept on the environmentally friendly Aleph Zero blockchain as non-fungible tokens, these digital copies guarantee their long-term survival. The Arctic World Archive, a Svalbard, Norway, facility meant to save valuable data from hazards like cyberattacks and natural disasters, will also house the tokenized artwork. Archiv3 reports that the AWA is well-known for keeping scientific and cultural records from entities like UNESCO and the Vatican.  The digital nature of blockchain art forces a rethink of the old conservation practices. In the long term, institutions should tally up the future sustainability of the platforms and the possible longevity of access, as technology evolves. This is not about preserving just the physical artifacts themselves but also the ecosystem surrounding digital art. Although blockchain clearly helps to preserve art, there are challenges to be solved. Many artworks, for example, are delicate or fleeting, which makes damage or loss especially likely. Conventional approaches such as climate-controlled environments have limited capability. Artists can build safe digital representations that preserve their worth and enable more general access by tokenizing these pieces as NFTs. Legal and ethical issues also come into play. Museums acquiring NFTs begs issues concerning ownership rights and value. Institutions navigating this new terrain have to have clear regulations addressing this complexity to guarantee fair practices in collecting and presenting blockchain art. The integration of blockchain technology into art preservation moves beyond the tide; it represents a paradigm shift in how one appreciates and understands the value and longevity of art. Art museums such as The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) are spearheading efforts to collect digital art from different creators, but more particularly, by women artists. Such moves not only improve collection diversification but contribute to setting a precedent for best future practices in the conservation of digital art. With this technology, more institutions are joining the bandwagon. Discussions over what art really is will continue developing. By embracing the best of the traditional expression of art and the latest technology, we are seeing the lines of appreciation and engagement with cultural heritage blur. Initiatives like Arctic vault by Pekao Bank ensure that our artistic legacy remains safe in such an ever-changing world.

The asset manager said Wednesday that the move was a \"massive step in the right direction\" to \"innovate in the name of a truly decentralized and accessible financial future.\" Aptos is the blockchain behind APT, the 30th-biggest digital coin by market cap. Its network was founded by part of the team behind Meta's failed Diem project. Developers can use the blockchain to build decentralized apps (dapps), launch tokens, and more. \"We chose the Aptos network given its unique characteristics, which meet our rigorous suitability standards for the Benji platform,\u201d Franklin Templeton's head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, said. FOBXX is a digitized fund that lets customers put cash into U.S. government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements. Investors can buy shares of FOBXX and hold them in digital wallets via Franklin Templeton's Benji Investments mobile app. Franklin Templeton has put the fund on a number of blockchains, including Avalanche, Arbitrum, Stellar, and Polygon. Avalanche was the most recent addition before Aptos, coming in late August. The firm said that FOBXX is the first and only U.S.-registered fund to use a public blockchain as the system of record to process transactions and record share ownership. Franklin Templeton has been dipping its toes in the crypto world since 2019, when it started digitizing shares for a money market fund on the Stellar blockchain. It also announced a digital asset venture fund two years ago.

The Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP), the company announced Thursday (Oct. 3), is available on Visa\u2019s development platform to allow its banking partners \u201cto create and experiment with their own fiat-backed tokens in a VTAP sandbox.\u201d The effort, Visa said in a news release provided to PYMNTS, will employ the company\u2019s expertise in technologies like smart contracts to let banks issue and transfer fiat-backed tokens over blockchain networks. \u201cVisa has been at the forefront of digital payments for nearly sixty years, and with the introduction of VTAP, we are once again setting the pace for the industry,\u201d Vanessa Colella, Visa\u2019s global head of innovation and digital partnerships, said in the release.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re excited to leverage our experience with tokenization to help banks integrate blockchain technologies into their operations.\u201d According to the release, Spanish bank BBVA has already been testing VTAP sandbox functionalities this year, including the issuance, transfer and redemption of a bank token on a testnet blockchain, along with interactions of the token with smart contracts. The bank aims to launch an initial live pilot with select customers on the public Ethereum blockchain next year, Visa added. The benefits of VTAP include its ease of integration, programmability and interoperability, the release notes. \u201cThere is a growing ecosystem where tokenized real-world assets are being issued across multiple permissioned and public blockchain networks,\u201d the company said. \u201cVisa\u2019s vision is to enable interoperability across different blockchains for banks utilizing the VTAP platform.\u201d With an API connection to VTAP, in the future, banks can allow multiple use cases and interact with partners and clients on permissioned and public blockchains.\u00a0 \u201cTo support the broad ecosystem adoption of tokenized assets, Visa is committed to enabling safe and secure cross-chain exchanges of tokenized real world assets using fiat-backed tokens,\u201d the release added. PYMNTS examined the role blockchain technology plays in cross-border payments in a recent conversation with Sheraz Shere, general manager of payments and commerce at Solana Foundation. \u201cBlockchain solutions and stablecoins, I don\u2019t like to use the term crypto because this is more about FinTech, they\u2019ve found product-market-fit in cross-border payments,\u201d Shere said. He added that one of the most notable benefits of blockchain technology is disintermediation \u2014 doing away with the need for the multiple hops through correspondent banks, which typically make transactions slower and more costly. \u00a0 We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors. ...",

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fraud prevention platform Trustpair announced the integration of investment bank JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain-based solution Confirm to verify bank account information on Oct. 1. Confirm is a closed network for global account validation information built on Liink, the enterprise-focused permissioned and private blockchain developed by JPMorgan\u2019s Onyx division. Gloria Wan, Executive Director at Onyx by J.P. Morgan, stated that Confirm was created to provide collective intelligence to improve decision-making for companies. She added: \u201cBusinesses operate in a data-driven world, yet many still rely on inaccurate vendor and payment data when making high-value transactions, which significantly raises companies\u2019 risk of fraud, payment errors, and delays.\u201d As a result, Trustpair\u2019s over 200 customers \u2014 including companies such as Societe Generale, Decathlon, and Danone \u2014 can now verify vendor bank accounts across 15 global markets, reducing the risk of payment fraud and payment delays. Trustpair\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Baptiste Collot, added that applying JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain solution will set a higher standard for fraud prevention and user experience. JPMorgan\u2019s stance towards the blockchain industry has changed considerably since 2017, when the lender\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon,\u00a0called Bitcoin a fraud. In 2019, the investment bank launched its own crypto \u2014 the JPM Coin \u2014 for wholesale payments between institutions. One year later, JPMorgan launched its blockchain-focused Onyx unit. JPMorgan executed its first transaction on a public blockchain in November 2022. The bank issued and swapped 100,000 Singaporean dollars for Japan\u2019s yen with SBI Digital Asset Holdings on the Polygon blockchain using a forked version of the leading money market Aave. According to Onyx\u2019s website, JPMorgan now provides three different major products leveraging blockchain besides Liink. Coin Systems is a bank-focused solution for transfer and clearing that leverages JPM Coin. Blockchain Launch is a team within the Onyx unit that provides blockchain service to JPMorgan\u2019s clients, while Onyx Digital Assets is the investment bank\u2019s tokenization platform.

            "content": "The 2024 Presidential election of the United States is only a couple of months away. With Joe Biden out of the race, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump from the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively, remain the top contenders for the leadership of the most powerful country in the world. Interestingly, for the first time, the blockchain industry is a key voting bloc that could play a very important role in the emergence of the 47th President of the United States. Usually, stakeholders in the blockchain industry, including Web 3.0 users and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, maintain a reserved stand on politics. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterik even recently sounded a note of warning against voting for candidates simply on the basis of their allegiance to decentralized technologies. However, the stakes are higher for the upcoming elections. The right candidate could mean the difference between a relapse into the stifling \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d environment the industry currently battles under the Biden administration or a renewed approach that will drive innovation and sustain investor\u2019s interest. The voting significance of the blockchain/crypto community is also not lost to the Democratic and Republican parties, as contestants from either side have made moves to appeal to major industry stakeholders. All of these underline a crucial question \u2013 \u201cWhich candidate is better for the advancement of blockchain/Web 3.0 interests in the United States?\u201d To get a better context, let\u2019s look at the industry\u2019s current state. Pre-elections Thirty-eight percent of workers in the United States admit to using blockchain technology in their businesses, while over 40% of American adults own cryptocurrency. With the approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, there has been increased nationwide interest in digital assets and cryptocurrency. However, blockchain in the United States continues to grapple with a tricky landscape. Unclear regulatory guidelines, a perceived \u2018operation choke point 2.0\u2019 and the determined attempts of the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) under Gary Gensler to clamp down on \u201cunregistered securities\u201d have seen Coinbase, Ripple and Terra Labs, among others, slammed with contentious lawsuits. The ideal presidential candidate, among other things, would address policy change, promote fair regulations and encourage pro-blockchain development. The Trump option Key industry players \u2013 like Ryan Selkis, the CEO of Messari, the Winklevoss brothers of Gemini, Elon Musk and many others \u2013 consider former President Donald Trump as the ideal choice for blockchain innovation. And with good reason. Trump has been increasingly vocal in supporting digital assets and blockchain technology. A major highlight was the last Bitcoin conference in Nashville, where he made the headlines for his position in the industry and his newfound love for crypto. But this was not the case just a few years back. During his tenure as the President of the United States in 2021, Trump came down heavily on crypto in a post on X, where he clearly stated he was not a fan of digital assets. His change of mind and explicit declaration of support for blockchain has been a rallying call that has reflected positively on public polls. Beyond verbal reassurance, the republican nominee\u2019s financial disclosure documents reveal he has over a million dollars investment in Ethereum and three separate NFT collections that have made over $7.5 million in sales. His campaign team has also encouraged and received donations in crypto to the tune of $25 million at the end of July 2024. At the Bitcoin conference, Trump also commented about firing Gery Gensler, prioritizing blockchain tech growth in the US and shutting down CBDCs (central bank digital currencies). These and many more of Trump\u2019s bold and vocal stance on the blockchain have endeared him to the crypto majority and positioned him as a much-needed ally to turn the tide politically. Kamala Harris However, Polymarket, the world\u2019s largest decentralized prediction market, shows a keenly contested battle ahead, with Kamala Harris trailing only a few points behind Trump. Harris clinched the presidential nomination of the democratic party after Joe Biden stepped down and is vying to become the first female President of the United States. Unlike Trump, Kamala Harris has refrained from any public commentary on how to approach the blockchain industry. Similarly, the recently released 92-page official platform of the DNC (democratic national committee) had no direct or implied mention of blockchain, crypto or digital assets, sparking rumors that Kamala Haris may toe the Biden line. On the flip side, however, there are already positive signs that a democratic presidency may favor blockchain sentiment, especially with ongoing efforts from the DNC to reach out and interact with industry stakeholders. Billionaires like Mike Cuban, with extensive investments in Web 3.0 companies including Polygon, OpenSea and Arbitrum, are also betting on the democratic candidate. In addition, the commitment of Tim Walz, Harris\u2019s running mate, to clean energy policies could significantly shape the future of crypto mining and pave the way for a more environmentally sustainable approach. The personal stance of Harris concerning the blockchain industry, however, remains unclear and may be the biggest drawback for moderate voters and the younger, more tech-savvy demography. Beyond elections In the broader tech ecosystem \u2013 especially with the emergence of AI, the impact of which is currently sweeping access to all sectors \u2013 what will Trump or Harris\u2019s win mean for solutions incorporating blockchain technology? Since its explosive resurgence last year, AI (artificial intelligence) has highlighted the need for decentralized technologies to bridge the infrastructural and computing gap that traditional tech companies have not been able to fill. Decentralized marketplaces and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) have enjoyed growing popularity in the past year due to their affordability and competitive edge, especially in executing AI projects. However, a tight leash on AI development will spill over to blockchain, limiting the potential capabilities of Web 3.0 and DePIN. An elected Trump will be actively seeking a repeal of the 2023 Biden AI executive order in a bid to loosen the reins and give more room for development. While this is good news for innovation, critics are concerned about the potential deleterious effect of unchecked growth in the AI sector. The explosive pace of acceleration of generative AI technology \u2013 although capable of yielding short-term gains for Web 3.0 \u2013 may create new social problems. Take, for example, the emergence of dangerously accurate deep fakes. On the other hand, democratic Harris will most likely seek to uphold the executive order, pushing for more guidelines to structure the sector with emphasis on consumer protection laws \u2013 an approach sources claim the majority of Republican and Democratic voters inherently support. Rounding off November 5th, 2024, is gearing up to be a pivotal moment for the future of Web 3.0 in the United States. With blockchain as a major talking point, regulatory clarity and the perceived ability to implement favorable policies will play a crucial role in the outcome of the elections. Currently, only the Trump candidacy has articulated and maintained these ideals. Therefore, except for a last-minute solid pro-blockchain move by the democratic team, Donald Trump remains the prime choice for many industry stakeholders and enthusiasts.

            "content": "Visa has introduced a new product aimed at revolutionizing the way banks engage with blockchain technology. The Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) will allow financial institutions to issue fiat-backed tokens on blockchain networks. The platform is designed to help banks seamlessly bridge traditional fiat currencies with emerging blockchain-based assets. According to Visa\u2019s announcement, VTAP offers a secure and efficient way for banks to mint, burn, and transfer fiat-backed tokens, such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins. This product represents Visa\u2019s latest effort to advance digital payment technologies by leveraging blockchain innovation. The platform is available on the Visa Developer Platform, allowing participating financial institutions to experiment with and test their own fiat-backed tokens in a sandbox environment. Visa\u2019s press release emphasized its global reach, with over 15,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories already benefiting from Visa\u2019s payment technologies. By launching VTAP, Visa is taking its expertise in digital payments to the blockchain, providing banks with tools to integrate blockchain technology into their existing financial systems. Visa says this product allows for programmability, enabling banks to use smart contracts and automate workflows for various financial applications. One key feature Visa highlighted is VTAP\u2019s interoperability across both permissioned and public blockchains. Visa\u2019s platform is designed to allow banks to interact with multiple blockchain ecosystems through a single API connection, making it easier for them to manage tokenized assets. Visa explained that interoperability is essential to support broad adoption of tokenized assets, with VTAP serving as the bridge between various blockchain networks.

Archiv3 was launched in partnership with Aleph Zero, a layer 1 blockchain platform known for its speed, data confidentiality, and ease of development, and Degen House. Archiv3 will use the Aleph Zero blockchain to tokenize and preserve Polish cultural heritage with digital reproductions securely stored in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), also known as the \u201cDoomsday Library.\u201d Bank Pekao hopes this initiative will go a long way in ensuring the masterpieces are secured for their cultural significance and to serve as resources for future study.\u00a0 Archiv3 will meticulously digitize masterpieces from iconic Polish artists such as Wojciech Kossak, Jan Matejko, Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski, and others. The artwork collection features a range of historical periods, particularly works from the 19th century. It also features a selection of modern pieces, such as works by contemporary artist Lia Kimura. Degen House, which currently serves as the bank\u2019s technological partner and manages the Aleph Zero integration, will facilitate these pieces.\u00a0 According to the term behind the project, the process began with creating high-quality museum-grade 3D scans using ultra-sensitive cameras. These cameras are designed to capture every detail of the original artwork for reproduction.\u00a0Once reproduced, the digital replicas were minted as NFTs on the Aleph Zero blockchain and archived on the Arctic World Archive. These digital replicas will securely remain on the AWA for at least 1000 years. Notably, through the Archiv3 project, Bank Pekao became the first universal bank to preserve and tokenize historical art.\u00a0 The project is part of the bank\u2019s ongoing commitment to modernize its services and expand its reach within the digital market.\u00a0 Commenting on the launch, Micha\u0142 Wal\u0119czak, Director of the Private Banking Strategy and Development Department at Bank Pekao S.A stated: \u201cWe have chosen Aleph Zero for their privacy-focused, top-class technology combined with sound experience in cooperation with large institutions. Minimal carbon footprint as well as low storage costs were also important factors in our decision-making process. Tokenization of art requires modern and flexible technology, unforced creativity, and some out-of-the-box thinking; these features we were happy to find in co-operation with Aleph Zero.\u201d The Artic World Archive is a highly secure data vault created in 2017 to protect invaluable culture, scientific information, and historical resources. Located on the remote Svalbard archipelago, it is designed to store data for long periods without the need for human or electric intervention. The valuable data stored include the Vatican Library, the entire GitHub code repository, documentation from UNICEF and UNESCO, and literary works by Nobel Prize laureates Wislawa Szymborska and Olga Tokarczuk.  ...",

In a recent newsletter, Morehead points to Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 decision to mention the blockchain sector in a speech last week. At a campaign event in Pittsburgh on September 25th, Harris spoke about the importance of the country\u2019s technological and industrial strength. \u201cI will recommit the nation to global leadership in the sectors that will define the next century. We will invest in biomanufacturing and aerospace; remain dominant in AI (artificial intelligence) and quantum computing, blockchain and other emerging technologies; expand our lead in clean energy innovation and manufacturing so the next generation of breakthroughs from advanced batteries to geothermal to advanced nuclear are not just invented but built here in America by American workers.\u201d Morehead describes the mention of blockchain as \u201ca very important policy leap\u201d for Harris. \u201cIn policy, that first step is just so hard. Once you\u2019ve done it, it\u2019s easy to continue along that path. Now I\u2019m confident that whichever candidate wins, the United States will have rational policy on blockchain.\u201d It\u2019s not the only time Harris has mentioned the sector: At a fundraiser in New York City last month, the vice president vowed to help grow investments in digital asset technology, according to a report from Bloomberg. \u201cI will bring together labor, small business founders and innovators and major companies. We will partner together to invest in America\u2019s competitiveness, to invest in America\u2019s future.
